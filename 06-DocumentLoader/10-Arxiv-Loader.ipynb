We believe that\\nour study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity and underscores the need for strengthening the reliability\\nand security of large language models (LLMs).\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nChatGPT, as a large language model (LLM), has revolu-\\ntionized the way users acquire information. Unlike conven-\\ntional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves knowledge from\\nthe model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT’s\\nquestion-answering (QA) process typically flows smoothly\\nlike a natural chat, enhancing the user experience and en-\\ncouraging the general public to migrate to it. By January\\n2023, ChatGPT has crossed the 100-million-user milestone,\\nmaking it the fastest-growing platform in history [1].\\nGiven the enormous usage, i.e., 1 billion queries per\\nday [1], ChatGPT has raised concerns about its question-\\nanswering reliability in generic knowledge domains, e.g.,\\nscience, technology, law, medicine, etc. These concerns are\\nfurther compounded by the fact that ChatGPT’s proficiency\\nin articulating rich answers may foster trust among ordinary\\nusers who often lack the expertise or are negligent to iden-\\ntify mistakes in the model’s responses [59]. For instance, in\\nMay 2023, a lawyer used ChatGPT to retrieve legal cases for\\na brief against the Colombian airline Avianca. However, it\\nwas subsequently revealed that these cases did not exist, re-\\nsulting in sanctions on the lawyer [72]. Similarly, in April\\n2023, when asked to generate a list of legal scholars involved\\nin sexual harassment incidents, ChatGPT fabricated a sexual\\nharassment scandal involving a real professor [68]. These\\ninstances of ChatGPT’s unreliability extend beyond individ-\\nual incidents, as they can have far-reaching consequences for\\nlegal proceedings, reputation damage, and the spread of mis-\\ninformation.\\nThere exists some preliminary research evaluating the effi-\\ncacy of ChatGPT on question-answering [12,76]. However,\\nthey either use only limited samples or concentrate on ques-\\ntions of certain types or from certain QA datasets. While\\nthese evaluations provide valuable insights into ChatGPT’s\\ncapabilities, they may not fully reflect the diversity and com-\\nplexity of questions that ChatGPT could face.\\nMoreover,\\nChatGPT allows users to steer its behaviors by describing\\ndirections via system role [3], such as “you are a helpful\\nassistant.” While multiple system roles have been widely\\ndiscussed in the user community [2, 10, 61] and integrated\\ninto various applications [5, 6, 9], a systematic investigation\\ninto the impact of these system roles on ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity is still lacking. In addition, due to ChatGPT’s popularity,\\nit is inevitable that malicious users will, if not already, at-\\ntack ChatGPT with adversarial examples. It remains unclear\\nwhether such attacks are indeed feasible.\\nResearch Questions. To address the above issues, in this\\npaper, we measure ChatGPT’s reliability in generic question-\\nanswering (QA) scenarios from following three perspectives.\\n1. RQ1: Is ChatGPT reliable in generic QA scenarios?\\n2. RQ2: Do system roles impact ChatGPT’s reliability?\\n3. RQ3: Can ChatGPT respond reliably when facing ad-\\nversarial examples?\\nEvaluation Framework. To quantitatively evaluate Chat-\\nGPT’s reliability in the generic question-answering use\\ncases, we build an evaluation framework consisting of\\ntwo main steps: 1) establishing a representative evaluation\\ndataset and 2) assessing answers from ChatGPT (see Sec-\\ntion 3). Concretely, we collect ten QA datasets across four\\n1\\narXiv:2304.08979v2  [cs.CR]  5 Oct 2023\\nanswer types, i.e., yes/no (YN), multiple-choice (MC), ex-\\ntractive (EX), and abstractive (AB). We leverage thematic\\nanalysis to align them to a unified dataset, resulting in 5,695\\nquestions across eight question domains, including history,\\nlaw, general works, medicine, social science, science, tech-\\nnology, and recreation.\\nWe evaluate ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity through two perspectives: correctness and unanswerable\\nquestion identification. Our rationale is that, when answer-\\ning questions, ChatGPT should not only provide correct an-\\nswers (correctness) but can identify situations where no an-\\nswer should be provided (unanswerable question detection)\\nas well. The latter capability is especially critical in sensi-\\ntive domains such as law and medicine, as the inquirer often\\nlacks the expertise to discern errors among answers [59]. We\\nalso conduct qualitative analysis to understand why ChatGPT\\nfails to answer some questions or refuses to answer them.\\nIs ChatGPT Reliable in Generic Question-Answering\\nScenarios. We observe ChatGPT exhibits varying levels of\\nreliability in different domains. While ChatGPT shows rela-\\ntively high correctness in the recreation and technology ques-\\ntions, it underperforms in law and science domains. For ex-\\nample, the correctness of law questions on EX and AB tasks\\nis respectively 11.97% and 4.29% lower than the overall av-\\nerage correctness. ChatGPT’s ability to identify unanswer-\\nable questions is also limited. On GPT-3.5, it achieves a\\nrate of only 26.63%, and on GPT-4, the rate is even lower\\n(14.29%).\\nThese findings indicate that, when faced with\\nunanswerable questions, ChatGPT is prone to make mean-\\ningless guesses instead of rejecting the questions outright.\\nThrough qualitative analysis, we identify four failure rea-\\nsons and four refusal reasons used by ChatGPT. Interestingly,\\nChatGPT tends to use the reason “not mentioned” to reject\\nto answer. We have confirmed similar behavior of ChatGPT\\non both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, suggesting that relying\\nsolely on model iteration is insufficient to solve reliability\\nissues.\\nDo System Roles Impact ChatGPT’s Reliability. We find\\nthat system roles may directly affect ChatGPT’s reliability.\\nFor instance, benign roles (Assistant, Expert, Expert-CoT,\\nand Expert-R) improve ChatGPT’s correctness on four QA\\ntasks, while bad and jailbreak roles generally reduce Chat-\\nGPT’s correctness and force it to select meaningless answers\\nto unanswerable questions. However, their impact is not al-\\nways evident from the role description alone. For instance,\\na jailbreak role may aim to circumvent restrictions but ulti-\\nmately result in decreased reliability. Our finding, for the first\\ntime, reveals how system roles can impact ChatGPT’s relia-\\nbility in an imperceptible way. We, therefore, emphasize the\\nimportance of evaluating a system role before applying it to\\nChatGPT.\\nCan ChatGPT Respond Reliably When Facing Adversar-\\nial Examples. Given the growing popularity of ChatGPT,\\nit is inevitable that malicious users will, if not already, at-\\ntack ChatGPT by carefully crafting adversarial examples as\\nits input.\\nIt is essential for ChatGPT to respond reliably\\nto these adversarial examples. Therefore, we also measure\\nChatGPT’s reliability against adversarial examples. We im-\\nplement five decision-based adversarial attacks with three\\nlevels of perturbations. We discover that ChatGPT is highly\\nvulnerable to sentence-level and character-level adversarial\\nattacks.\\nWe further manually engineer a prompt, namely\\nleakage prompt, to induce ChatGPT to disclose the confi-\\ndence scores. This enables us to implement score-based at-\\ntacks against ChatGPT and brings an average attack success\\nrate improvement of 0.38. Our qualitative analysis of the\\nadversarial examples identifies certain interesting cases like\\nchanging only one character is sufficient enough to alter the\\noutput of ChatGPT. These results demonstrate the vulnerabil-\\nity of ChatGPT to adversarial examples, highlighting the po-\\ntential safety/security risks associated with ChatGPT in prac-\\ntical applications.\\nOur Contributions. The contributions of the paper are as\\nsummarized as follows:\\n• We perform the first large-scale measurement of Chat-\\nGPT’s reliability in the generic QA scenario with a care-\\nfully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets\\nand eight domains. Our results suggest ChatGPT’s reli-\\nability varies among different domains. We also reveal\\nthe deficiency of ChatGPT in identifying unanswerable\\nquestions, which suggests that ChatGPT tends to make\\nmeaningless guesses rather than reject answers when\\nserving unanswerable questions.\\n• We then, for the first time, systematically investigate the\\nimpacts of system roles on ChatGPT’s reliability. Sur-\\nprisingly, we find system roles can impact ChatGPT’s\\nreliability in an imperceptible way. This emphasizes the\\nimportance of evaluating a system role before applying\\nit to ChatGPT.\\n• We also assess ChatGPT’s reliability against adversarial\\nattacks. Our results show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to\\nsentence-level and character-level adversarial examples,\\nhighlighting the potential security risks associated with\\nChatGPT.\\n2\\nBackground\\n2.1\\nChatGPT\\nChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) that\\nwas launched by OpenAI in November 2022. Based on the\\nenormous amount of knowledge it has learned during train-\\ning, ChatGPT can generate human-like responses to a wide\\nrange of prompts and questions [65]. Currently, the most\\nwidely used version of ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3.5\\narchitecture [23]. Access to ChatGPT on the GPT-4 model\\nis still limited and requires specific approval from OpenAI.\\nMoreover, ChatGPT allows users to define their task style by\\ndescribing those directions via roles, which are termed sys-\\ntem role by OpenAI. For example, users can write a prompt\\nstarting with “You are a helpful assistant”1 to direct Chat-\\nGPT to behave as an assistant.\\nUsers can also craft cer-\\ntain jailbreak messages, such as “You are going to pretend\\nto be DAN which stands for doing anything now” to get\\n1This is the officially recommended system role for ChatGPT.\\n2\\nTable 1: Four common QA tasks.\\nYes/NO QA (YN)\\nContext\\nA Long Island Iced Tea is a type of ...\\nQuestion\\nDo long island iced teas have tea in them?\\nAnswer\\nFALSE\\nMultiple-choice QA (MC)\\nContext\\nYou change the channels for the fourth time ...\\nQuestion\\nWhat is the most important for runners in a race?\\nOptions\\n(A) Having fun.

While Chat-\\nGPT instructed within the system roles has been increas-\\ningly used [2, 10, 61] and integrated into various applica-\\ntions [5,6,9], a systematic investigation of the effect of these\\nsystem roles is still lacking.\\n2.2\\nQuestion-Answering Task\\nQuestion-Answering (QA) is one of the main tasks in\\nNLP [26, 70].\\nGiven questions (and the context if any),\\nQA tasks evaluate a model’s capability in reading compre-\\nhension [24, 59, 60], information retrieval [36], logical rea-\\nsoning [74], and knowledge base [73].\\nBased on the an-\\nswer types, QA tasks can be generally categorized into four\\ntypes [41], i.e., yes/no [24], multiple-choice [25, 46, 51, 67],\\nextractive [59,60], and abstractive tasks [28,42,50] (see Ta-\\nble 1 for details). The yes/no task expects a simple “yes”\\nor “no” response, while the multiple-choice task requires the\\nmodel to select the correct answer from a set of given an-\\nswer candidates. The extractive task requires the model to\\nextract the answer from the context, and the abstractive task\\ndemands a free-form response from the model. Each of the\\nfour QA tasks elicits the model’s capability distinctively and\\nis evaluated with specific metrics; therefore, none of them\\ncan be easily substituted with one another. We refer the audi-\\nence to [63] for the overview of QA techniques and datasets.\\n3\\nEvaluation Framework\\n3.1\\nEvaluation Dataset\\nQA Datasets. We employ 10 widely used benchmark QA\\ndatasets in our study, including BoolQ [24], OpenbookQA\\n(OQA) [51], RACE [46], ARC [25], CommonsenseQA\\n(CQA) [67], SQuAD1 [60], SQuAD2 [59], NarrativeQA\\n(NQA) [42], ELI5 [28], and TruthfulQA (TQA) [50]. These\\ndatasets encompass a broad range of QA capabilities, such\\nas reading comprehension (BoolQ, SQuDA1/2, RACE), rea-\\nsoning (OQA, ARC), commonsense (CQA), full document\\ncomprehension (NQA, ELI5), and truthfulness (TQA). Fur-\\nthermore, they cover all four QA tasks [41], including yes/no\\n(BoolQ), multiple-choice (OQA, RACE, ARC, CQA), ex-\\ntractive (SQuAD 1/2), and abstractive tasks (NQA, ELI5,\\nTQA). They thus offer a solid foundation to comprehensively\\nevaluate the ChatGPT’s reliability in various real-world QA\\nscenarios. Their details are summarized in Table 2 and de-\\ntailed in Section A.1 in the Appendix.\\nQA Dataset Sampling. Our initial dataset comprises the\\nvalidation and test sets of each QA dataset.\\n1k records\\n(question-answering pairs) are randomly sampled from\\ndatasets whose validation set (or test set if the ground-truth\\nlabel is offered) contains over 2,000 question-answering\\npairs. Otherwise, the complete dataset is retained. Note,\\nRACE consists of two subsets, RACE-M from middle school\\nexams and RACE-H from high school exams, respectively.\\nFor each subset, we extract 1,000 records from its valida-\\ntion set, resulting in a total of 2,000 records from the RACE\\ndataset. This sampling method is motivated by three fac-\\ntors. First, we conduct a thematic analysis to group records\\ninto semantically similar domains. Given the necessity of hu-\\nman inspection, a smaller dataset is more practical. Second,\\ndata imbalance issues can be addressed to a certain extent\\nthrough this sampling method. For example, OQA and ARC\\nconcentrate on science and neglect other areas, such as law\\nand history. Consequently, more data from underrepresented\\ndomains can be obtained. Finally, due to ChatGPT API’s\\nslow response time of 10-20 seconds per query, evaluating\\nall records is impractical.\\nThematic Analysis. We then perform thematic analysis [17]\\nto pre-process the collected samples. The primary objective\\nof thematic analysis is to categorize the samples based on\\ntheir similarity in terms of semantics and domains, thereby\\nfacilitating meaningful and in-depth comparisons.\\nTo achieve this, we leverage BERTopic [32] to automat-\\nically topic modeling questions and then apply deductive\\nanalysis to assign these topics into broad domains. We test\\nfive pre-trained embedding models for BERTopic and choose\\nthe one with the highest CV coherence score (0.67) [62],\\nwhich is GTR-T5-XL. To address the potential misclassifi-\\ncations from the topic modeling method, we utilize the rep-\\nresentative score, which is the probability that a question be-\\nlongs to a specific topic, and empirically set the threshold at\\n0.5. Questions below this threshold are considered unclearly\\nclassified and subsequently filtered out. In the end, we ob-\\ntain 219 topics and 5,695 questions, out of which 410 ques-\\ntions are unanswerable. With manual inspection, we find the\\nresults are clustered by topics, e.g., Super Bowl, Sherlock\\nHolmes story, and so on. We then utilize a priori coding, a\\ncommon deductive approach in HCI, psychology, and usable\\nsecurity that categorize data samples with the guide of estab-\\nlished taxonomies or hypotheses [17, 29, 33, 47]. We refer\\nto the Library of Congress Classification [20] as our taxon-\\n3\\nTable 2: Statistics of QA datasets included in our testbed: one yes/no, four multiple-choice, two extractives, and three abstractive\\ndatasets. “idk” denotes unanswerable questions (e.g., 356 out of 698 questions from SQuAD2 are unanswerable).\\nQA Task\\nYes/NO QA (YN)\\nMultiple-choice QA (MC)\\nExtractive QA (EX)\\nAbstractive QA (AB)\\nDatasets\\nBoolQ\\nOQA\\nRACE\\nARC\\nCQA\\nSQuAD1\\nSQuAD2\\nNQA\\nELI5\\nTQA\\nHas context?\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n# of questions\\n1000\\n500\\n2000\\n869\\n1221\\n1000\\n1000\\n1000\\n1000\\n817\\n# of filtered questions\\n487\\n250\\n984\\n414\\n600\\n710\\n698\\n747\\n413\\n390\\n# of idk questions\\n356\\n54\\nEvaluation metric\\nAcc\\nAcc\\nF1\\nRougeL\\nData\\nSampling\\nThematic\\nAnalysis\\nTestbed\\n❶\\xa0Dataset\\xa0\\n❷\\xa0Pipeline\\n(a) Query Formation\\n(b)\\xa0ChatGPT Invocation\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"The answer\\xa0 ...\"\\nAcc\\nYN\\nMC\\nEX\\nAB\\nTrue\\n(A)\\n\"Cola\"\\n\"...\"\\nAcc\\nF1\\nRougeL\\n(c) Answer\\nExtraction\\xa0\\nQuestion Context Options\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"You are ...\"\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\"I will provide ...\"\\nUser\\nSystem\\n(d)\\xa0\\nEvaluation\\nFigure 1: Workflow of the evaluation framework.\\nomy as well as initial codes. Two authors independently re-\\nfine and merge codes over the process of coding. After the\\nfirst coding round, the authors discuss and adapt the code-\\nbook until all authors agreed on the codebook. They then\\nindependently re-code all questions and merge their codes\\nfor analysis. The final codebook (Table 9 in the Appendix)\\nincludes eight codes/domains namely history, law, general\\nworks, medicine, social science, science, technology, and\\nrecreation. The “general works” serves as a catch-all domain\\nfor questions that encompass multiple complex topics or do\\nnot fit precisely into any specific domain. Our results show a\\ngood inter-coder agreement (kappa = 0.74).\\nFigure 2 shows the Sankey diagram of our testbed. We rec-\\nognize that datasets are often collected from a single source\\nand involved various domains. For example, SQuAD1’s data\\nsource is Wikipedia, but the questions cover eight domains.\\nTherefore, thematic analysis enables us to better assess Chat-\\nGPT’s capability across different data sources, datasets, an-\\nswer types, and question domains.\\nNote. We acknowledge that certain domains, such as law,\\nmedicine, and technology, may be underrepresented in our\\nstudy. This may be attributed to the a priori coding proce-\\ndure, in which we have refrained from merging these three\\ndomains into a broader domain as we have done with other\\ndomains. For example, the recreation domain is derived from\\nmusic, fine arts, literature, and movies (see Table 9 in the\\nAppendix). Nevertheless, we ensure that each domain is ade-\\nquately represented in our study, with the technology domain\\ncontaining the least number of questions at 165.\\n3.2\\nEvaluation Pipeline\\nOverview. Our evaluation pipeline consists of four steps,\\nincluding query formation, ChatGPT invocation, answer ex-\\ntraction, and evaluation.

The first column represents the data source, the sec-\\nond column refers to the dataset, and the last column displays\\nquestion domains. The thickness of each edge corresponds to\\nthe number of questions.\\nQuery Formation. A complete query to ChatGPT includes\\ntwo messages: a system message that sets the system role\\n(see Section 2.1) and a user message that asks the question.\\nFor system message, we leave the system message blank to\\naccess the native ChatGPT in RQ1 (Section 4) and explore\\nhow different system roles affect ChatGPT’s reliability in\\nRQ2 (Section 5). For user message, we use prompts adopted\\nfrom [2, 43] to instruct ChatGPT to provide answers in the\\nrequired format for different QA tasks. Concretely, we en-\\ncapsulate the prompt with the question and necessary infor-\\nmation, e.g., context and options, as the user message. The\\nprompts of each QA task are presented in Table 8 in the Ap-\\npendix. Note that we do not consider advanced techniques\\nsuch as in-context learning [53] to construct our queries, as\\nthese methods may not be familiar or easily accessible to av-\\nerage users.\\nChatGPT Invocation. Our experiments are conducted on\\nChatGPT with its official API [3].\\nTo ensure the repro-\\nducibility of the results, we choose model endpoints “gpt-\\n3.5-turbo-0301” and “gpt-4-0314” as they are the official\\nsnapshots of GPT-3.5 from March 1st, 2023, and GPT-4 from\\nMarch 14th, 2023, with no updates. Following the default\\nsetting, we set the temperature as 1. We take ChatGPT with\\nGPT-3.5 as the basis in the following experiments. For GPT-\\n4, we randomly sample 1,000 questions from our testbed due\\nto the lower response speed and the limit of OpenAI’s restric-\\ntion.2\\nAnswer\\nExtraction.\\nBenefiting\\nfrom\\nChatGPT’s\\ninstruction-following nature [40], we observe ChatGPT’s\\n2The maximum usage OpenAI allows for a user is 120$ each month, which\\nis around 1,000 questions (repeated 5 times) for GPT-4 in our testbed.\\n4\\nresponse in most cases follow the guide we defined in the\\nprompt, facilitating automatic answer extraction for different\\nQA tasks.\\nIn accordance with the required answer types\\noutlined in Section 2.2, we extract the appropriate answer\\nfrom ChatGPT’s responses. Concretely, we extract options\\nselected by ChatGPT, i.e., (A), for YN and MC tasks; the\\nsubstring tokens for EX tasks; and retain the complete Chat-\\nGPT response for AB tasks. For responses that do not follow\\nthe expected format, two human annotators are assigned to\\nindependently extract the answers or determine the refusal\\nreasons. They then discuss and arrive at a conclusion. This\\nis a de facto action taken when acting with LLMs [43].\\nEvaluation. We consider two critical capabilities to assess\\nChatGPT’s reliability: correctness and unanswerable ques-\\ntion identification. First, ChatGPT should answer correctly\\nwhen serving questions (correctness). To measure this ca-\\npability, following previous work [43], we calculate the ac-\\ncuracy for YN and MC tasks; the F1 and RougeL metrics\\nfor EX and AB tasks, respectively. Second, ChatGPT should\\nrecognize situations where no answers can be provided [59].\\nThis capability is particularly vital in sensitive domains like\\nlaw, where the inquirer may lack the expertise to distinguish\\nerrors among answers. To evaluate this capability, we calcu-\\nlate the identification rate of ChatGPT among unanswerable\\nquestions (unanswerable question identification).\\nNote. ChatGPT is essentially a generative language model;\\nhence its answer generation is stochastic. All experiments are\\ntherefore repeated five times and we report the mean values\\nin the rest of the paper.\\n4\\nIs ChatGPT Reliable in Generic Question-\\nAnswering Scenarios?\\nMotivation. ChatGPT’s ability to understand complex ques-\\ntions and generate rich responses in natural language makes\\nthe user interaction a seamless question-and-answer process.\\nThis proficiency may foster trust in ordinary users toward the\\nresponses provided by ChatGPT. However, to the best of our\\nknowledge, current research has not comprehensively bench-\\nmarked if ChatGPT (both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can provide\\ncorrect answers in various domains (e.g., science, history,\\netc.), and identify situations where no answer should be given\\nin sensitive domains (e.g., law, medicine, etc.). Therefore,\\nwe address these essential questions in this section.\\n4.1\\nCorrectness\\nOverall Correctness. As we can see in Figure 3, ChatGPT’s\\ncorrectness varies across question domains. It achieves good\\ncorrectness on recreation and technology while underper-\\nforming in law and science in most datasets. For instance, the\\ndifferences between the average scores on recreation ques-\\ntions and the overall average scores given YN, MC, EX,\\nand AB tasks are +3.21%, +0.15%, +18.31%, and +4.09%.\\nIn contrast, the differences between the average correctness\\nscores on law questions and those of the same four tasks are\\n-3.18%, -1.62%, -11.97%, and -4.29%. By carefully inspect-\\ning ChatGPT’s answer to failed cases, we find that ChatGPT\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\nARC (Acc)\\nRACE (Acc)\\nCQA (Acc)\\nOQA (Acc)\\nSQuAD1 (F1)\\nSQuAD2 (F1)\\nTQA (RougeL)\\nELI5 (RougeL)\\nNQA (RougeL)\\nRecreation\\nTechnology\\nHistory\\nMedicine\\nGeneral Works\\nSocial science\\nScience\\nLaw\\nAverage\\n88.06\\n87.01 74.51\\n79.67 70.00 61.67 19.55 28.42\\n87.69 95.29 91.63 94.12 75.38 74.55 69.93 72.00 20.14 27.25\\n91.72\\n81.11 55.56\\n76.74 46.69 44.21 15.86 27.56\\n86.40\\n88.51 92.14\\n43.35 45.08 70.37 19.56\\n84.38 96.15 86.18 75.48 83.53 68.38 42.74 45.34 20.64 26.86\\n86.67\\n77.18 76.79\\n71.53 39.67 43.86 18.46 15.46\\n81.40 91.21 81.11 77.32 79.13 64.10 42.23 61.59 20.02\\n81.67\\n84.29 70.48\\n48.20 40.92 39.39 21.40\\n84.85 91.55 84.63 76.60 79.36 68.99 44.07 49.74 19.64 27.98\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\nFigure 3: ChatGPT correctness across domains and datasets.\\nThe white cell represents no questions.\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\nARC (Acc)\\nRACE (Acc)\\nCQA (Acc)\\nOQA (Acc)\\nSQuAD1 (F1)\\nSQuAD2 (F1)\\nTQA (RougeL)\\nELI5 (RougeL)\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nCorrectness (%)\\nGPT-3.5\\nGPT-4\\nFigure 4: ChatGPT correctness on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\\nprefers to create hallucinatory facts when it provides wrong\\nanswers (see Section 4.3 for detailed failure analysis).\\nGPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4. Figure 4 reports the correctness across\\ndifferent ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). Overall,\\nwe find that GPT-4 shows slightly better correctness than\\nGPT-3.5. For instance, in the CQA dataset, GPT-4 achieves a\\ncorrectness rate of 79.03%, demonstrating a 2.43% increase\\ncompared to GPT-3.5. However, the performance is still far\\nfrom regarding it as a reliable QA system. By carefully in-\\nspecting answers, we observe similar behaviors on both GPT-\\n3.5 and GPT-4 models. Our results suggest that only relying\\non model upgrades is insufficient to solve reliability issues.\\nQuestion Tense. Tense refers to the grammatical concept\\nindicating when an action or state of being occurs.\\nLan-\\nguage models need to identify question tenses to provide cor-\\nrect answers [52, 55]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s proficiency in\\nvarious tenses, we utilize spaCy3 to conduct morphological\\nanalysis to identify question tense. We present the correct-\\nness with different tenses in Figure 5. Our analysis reveals\\nthat, in most cases, ChatGPT attains slightly better correct-\\nness in present-tense questions. For instance, in the ELI5\\ndataset, present-tense questions yield a mean RougeL score\\nof 0.21, whereas the past-tense question score is only 0.18.\\nWe speculate that this could be due to ChatGPT’s training\\nset bias. However, without access to the ChatGPT training\\nset, we leave this question open for future research.

Due\\nto space constraints, we refer the readers to Section A.3 in the\\nAppendix.\\n4.2\\nUnanswerable Question Identification\\nIn addition to providing reliable responses, a crucial capabil-\\nity for large language models is to recognize situations where\\nno answer should be provided. This capability is especially\\ncritical in sensitive domains such as law and medicine, where\\nthe inquirer often lacks the expertise to identify mistakes in\\nthe model’s answers [59]. To evaluate ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity in this regard, we measure ChatGPT’s identification rate\\non unanswerable questions marked in the original datasets\\n(see Table 2). As shown in Table 3, ChatGPT only identi-\\nfies 26.63% and 14.29% unanswerable questions with GPT-\\n3.5 and GPT-4 models, respectively. Note that the GPT-4\\nmodel performs even worse in this regard. These low identi-\\nfication rates suggest that ChatGPT tends to make meaning-\\nless guesses rather than reject answers when serving unan-\\nswerable questions. For example, when asked “Who com-\\nposed the tune of ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’?” where the\\ncomposer is still a mystery in history, and thus no answer\\nshould be offered. ChatGPT incorrectly responds with Wolf-\\ngang Amadeus Mozart as the composer. This finding raises\\nconcerns about ChatGPT’s reliability on unanswerable ques-\\ntions. We hope that this study may motivate future research\\nin this direction.\\n4.3\\nQualitative Analysis\\nFailure Analysis. To investigate possible reasons for Chat-\\nGPT’s suboptimal reliability in the generic QA scenario (see\\nSection 4.1), we randomly sample 100 records in our testbed\\nand inspect the questions, context (if present), correct an-\\nswers, and 5 ChatGPT’s answers towards the same questions\\nto eliminate the randomness. We observe that hallucinatory\\nRACE\\nSQuAD2\\nARC\\nELI5\\nTQA\\nCQA\\nBoolQ\\nMedicine\\nSocial Science\\nScience\\nRecreation\\nGeneral Works\\nTechnology\\nLaw\\nHistory\\nInappropriate (4.0)\\nIt Depends (5.6)\\nNot Mentioned\\n(34.2)\\nNo Knowledge (0.8)\\nFigure 6: Sankey diagram illustrating the refusal reasons. The\\nthickness of each edge corresponds to the number of questions.\\nfacts cause the most common failure and appear in 6.8%\\nChatGPT’s answers on average. For instance, ChatGPT’s an-\\nswer to the law question “In the U.S., can the victim of a do-\\nmestic violence case drop the charges?” is “Yes, the victim\\nof a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in\\nthe United States...” This response, however, contradicts the\\nUnited States law and policy.4 Moreover, ChatGPT exhibits\\nother forms of failure, including casual answers (4.8%), ref-\\nerential confusion (3.8%), and lack of knowledge (3.4%).\\nWe suspect this behavior is possibly due to its reasoning lim-\\nitations, as it can only generate responses based on training\\ndata it has processed [16]. Therefore, ChatGPT may not thor-\\noughly understand the physical and social world, leading to\\nincoherent answers. We also make similar observations on\\nGPT-4. We provide examples of each failure reason in Ta-\\nble 10 in the Appendix.\\nRefusal Analysis.\\nWe manually analyze ChatGPT’s re-\\nsponses and identify four primary reasons for refusal: “not\\nmentioned,” “inappropriate,” “it depends,” and “no knowl-\\nedge.” A detailed explanation of each reason, along with ex-\\namples, can be found in Table 11 in the Appendix. We further\\nexclude unanswerable questions from our analysis and focus\\non those that ChatGPT could theoretically answer. Figure 6\\nshows the distribution of refusal reasons. We observe that\\nChatGPT’s most common reason for refusal is that it con-\\nsiders the context insufficient to provide a reliable answer,\\nas indicated by the reason “not mentioned.” For example,\\nwhen asked “Tweed is a rare fabric in modern clothing; what\\nbrand should I look for when buying it?” (see Table 11 in\\nthe Appendix) where the correct answer is option (E) “Eddie\\nBauer” as it is the only brand in the options. However, Chat-\\nGPT believes none of the options are correct and thus refuses\\nto make a choice. This suggests the deficiencies of ChatGPT.\\nIn some cases, ChatGPT may be unable to provide an answer\\nor acknowledge its limitations. Instead, ChatGPT blames the\\nquestion for being ambiguous or poorly worded, potentially\\ninfluencing the user’s judgment of its reliability.\\n4.4\\nTakeaways\\nWe demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits different reliability\\nin various domains. While ChatGPT shows relatively high\\ncorrectness in the recreation and technology questions, it un-\\nderperforms in law and science domains in most datasets.\\n4https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/legal-advice/\\ndropping-domestic-violence-charge.\\n6\\nWe also identify ChatGPT’s deficiencies in identifying unan-\\nswerable questions with rates of only 26.63% and 14.29% on\\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, respectively. This suggests that\\nChatGPT is prone to make meaningless guesses rather than\\nrejecting the questions when serving unanswerable ques-\\ntions. With qualitative analysis, we reveal four failure rea-\\nsons and four refusal reasons used by ChatGPT. Interestingly,\\nthe most common reason ChatGPT used to reject questions\\nis “not mentioned” rather than “no knowledge.” Considering\\nquestions in the refusal analysis are all answerable, this indi-\\ncates that ChatGPT may be dishonest in admitting its limita-\\ntions, potentially influencing the user’s judgment of its capa-\\nbility.\\n5\\nDo System Roles Impact ChatGPT’s Relia-\\nbility?\\nMotivation. ChatGPT allows users to leverage its system\\nrole [3] to customize their tasks (i.e., guiding their model’s\\nbehavior by setting up a specific system prompt via OpenAI\\nAPI). This capability has gained immense popularity in the\\ncommunity [2,10,61] and has been incorporated into various\\napplications [5,6,9]. However, a systematic inquiry into the\\nimpact of these system roles on ChatGPT’s reliability is still\\nlacking. We thus fill this gap in this section. We consider\\nfour benign roles, two bad roles, and two jailbreak roles. The\\nbenign roles include an assistant (Assistant), an expert (Ex-\\npert), an expert using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompt [44]\\n(Expert-CoT), and an expert intended to refuse unanswer-\\nable questions (Expert-R). The bad roles include a bad as-\\nsistant (Bad) and a bad assistant with an additional emphasis\\non providing convincing but incorrect answers (Bad-M). We\\nalso consider two in-the-wild jailbreak roles, namely DAN5\\nand ChatAGI.6 These system roles are designed to bypass the\\nsystem’s safeguards and usage policies. DAN, as the name\\nsuggests, aims to instruct ChatGPT to “do anything now”\\nwhile ChatAGI focuses on providing unrestricted answers.\\nAdditional details on these system roles are provided in Ta-\\nble 12 in the Appendix.\\n5.1\\nCorrectness\\nBenign Roles. Table 4 summarizes ChatGPT’s correctness\\nwith different system roles. We observe that benign roles can\\nenhance ChatGPT’s correctness across four QA tasks. Take\\nthe OQA dataset as an example, Assistant, Expert, Expert-\\nCoT, and Expert-R roles improve ChatGPT’s correctness by\\n1.68%, 3.92%, 3.84%, and 1.52%, respectively, compared to\\nthat of ChatGPT without a system role. Additionally, using\\nthe CoT prompt, which instructs users to think step by step,\\ncan further improve ChatGPT’s correctness in some cases.\\nFor instance, the Expert-CoT role achieves 75.10% correct-\\nness on the SQuAD1 dataset, while the Expert and Expert-R\\nroles obtain 72.37% and 71.82% correctness, respectively.\\nHowever, benign roles may underperform in certain datasets.\\n5https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/\\n106azp6/dan_do_anything_now/.\\n6https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/\\n11vc27e/the_2_most_important_bypass_prompts_available/.\\nOn the SQuAD2 dataset, we find that all benign roles fail to\\nimprove ChatGPT’s correctness except for the Expert-R role.\\nWe attribute this drop to the decreased capability of detect-\\ning unanswerable questions (see Section 5.2). To compare,\\nthe Expert-R role, which is instructed to reject unanswerable\\nquestions, improves the correctness by 5.82%.\\nBad Roles. To our surprise, bad roles do not necessarily\\nharm ChatGPT’s correctness.\\nFor instance, the Bad role\\nactually increases ChatGPT’s correctness in most datasets.\\nAs it is only slightly different from the Assistant role, i.e.,\\nby changing “assistant” to “bad assistant” (see Table 12 in\\nthe Appendix), we speculate that ChatGPT might be robust\\nagainst simple negative modal words such as “bad.” Nev-\\nertheless, the Bad-M role, which requires ChatGPT to de-\\nliberately return wrong answers, results in an apparent de-\\ncrease in correctness across most datasets. For example, in\\nthe CQA dataset, the Bad-M role reduces correctness from\\n76.60% (W/o role) to 37.10%.\\nJailbreak Roles. We find that jailbreak roles can also af-\\nfect ChatGPT’s correctness, especially the DAN role, which\\ndrops the correctness of all datasets except the ELI5 dataset.\\nFor example, ChatGPT with the DAN role obtains 65.08%\\ncorrectness on the RACE dataset, which represents almost a\\n19.55% drop compared to that of ChatGPT without a system\\nrole. Moreover, for both the DAN and ChatAGI roles, the\\ncorrectness on SQuAD2 heavily decreases from 44.07% to\\n34.71% and 39.36%, respectively. By manually inspecting\\nthe responses, we speculate that this might be credited to the\\npurpose of the two jailbreak roles. Recall that the main pur-\\npose of the jailbreak roles is to break restrictions imposed by\\nChatGPT’s safeguards. The side effect is that they may also\\nforce ChatGPT to find meaningless answers to unanswerable\\nquestions to comply with the instructions. We provide addi-\\ntional analysis in Section 5.2.\\n5.2\\nUnanswerable Question Identification\\nWe report ChatGPT’s unanswerable question identification\\nratio in Figure 7a. Surprisingly, we find that almost all sys-\\ntem roles decrease ChatGPT’s ability to detect unanswerable\\nquestions, particularly the jailbreak roles. For instance, when\\ninstructed within the DAN role, ChatGPT can only identify\\n9.07% of unanswerable questions. This decrease can be at-\\ntributed to the purpose of jailbreak roles, which are designed\\nto motivate ChatGPT to actively answer questions, poten-\\ntially impacting its ability to detect unanswerable questions.\\nAdditionally, the Expert-R role shows improved identifica-\\ntion capability in this scenario, with a rate of 29.36%. This\\nimprovement can be credited to the instruction to refuse un-\\ncertain questions. However, even with the improved result,\\nthe detection rate is still far from satisfactory.\\n5.3\\nQualitative Analysis\\nFailure Analysis. We reuse the same 100 questions in Sec-\\ntion 4.3 to better understand how different system roles affect\\nChatGPT’s correctness (see Figure 7b). We find that benign\\nsystem roles increase the reliability of ChatGPT by reduc-\\ning the hallucinatory facts and casual answers, however, they\\n7\\nTable 4: ChatGPT’s correctness with different system roles.

In addition, bad roles and jailbreak\\nroles show a tendency to increase all four kinds of failures.\\nFor example, DAN induces ChatGPT to produce 4% more\\nhallucinatory facts in its generated answers. By carefully in-\\nvestigating ChatGPT’s answers, we find ChatGPT with sys-\\ntem roles tends to supply more convincing statements, e.g.,\\ndetailed fake data or irrelative theory, to support its false an-\\nswers, making it more challenging to identify whether its an-\\nswers are true or false. Table 7 in the Appendix shows a\\ntypical example of hallucinatory facts. When answering the\\nquestion “Which states are more obese than West Virginia”,\\nChatGPT with benign and bad roles, i.e., Expert-CoT and\\nBad, both claim their answers refer to the data from CDC\\nin 2019 or 2020 with specific numbers, which are both fake.\\nBased on these observations, we find that ChatGPT is still\\nlimited and unreliable when answering questions, even with\\nsystem roles. Moreover, the fake data or irrelative theory pro-\\nvided by ChatGPT with system roles can cause users to trust\\nits answers without verifying the accuracy themselves. As a\\nresult, the false information generated by ChatGPT becomes\\nharder to detect and inadvertently spreads more easily.\\nRefusal Analysis. Figure 7c shows the rejected numbers of\\nanswerable questions. We first notice that all system roles\\nenable ChatGPT to reject fewer questions, except the Expert-\\nR role. This is expected, as the Expert-R role encourages\\nChatGPT to carefully consider questions and refuse uncer-\\ntain ones (see Table 12 in the Appendix). Among all the\\nrest system roles, interestingly, we find that the two jailbreak\\nroles do not perform as well as the Expert-CoT role in re-\\nducing ChatGPT’s rejected question numbers, even though\\nthis is their main design purpose. For instance, the DAN and\\nChatAGI roles only reduce ChatGPT’s rejected number from\\n28.6 to 15 and 13.4, respectively, while the Expert-CoT role\\nobtains the lowest number of rejected questions, i.e., 12.2\\nquestions. Our finding indicates the ineffectiveness of these\\nin-the-wild jailbreak roles. Even with multiple manually op-\\ntimized instructions, these jailbreak roles fail to decrease the\\nrejected number as effectively as the Expert-CoT role, a sim-\\nple system role with only one additional instruction.\\n5.4\\nTakeaways\\nWe find that system roles may directly influence ChatGPT’s\\nreliability.\\nFor instance, benign roles (Assistant, Expert,\\nExpert-CoT, and Expert-R) improve ChatGPT’s correctness\\non four QA tasks, while bad and jailbreak roles usually re-\\nduce ChatGPT’s correctness and force it to select meaning-\\nless answers to unanswerable questions. We argue these ob-\\nservations on system roles are critical and must be given at-\\ntention by users. System roles possess the capability to not\\nonly steer ChatGPT’s behaviors but also impact its correct-\\nness as well as decrease its unanswerable question detecting\\nratio. Worse, its impact is not easily discernible from the\\nsystem role itself. For instance, a jailbreak role may aim to\\nbreak restrictions but ultimately result in decreased correct-\\nness. This finding highlights the need to search for more\\nreliable system roles and thoroughly evaluate the reliability\\nof the system role before applying it to a real application.\\n6\\nCan ChatGPT Respond Reliably When Fac-\\ning Adversarial Examples?\\nMotivation. Based on our findings in RQ1 and RQ2, we\\nhave identified several factors that can impact ChatGPT’s re-\\n8\\nliability, including question domains and system roles. Given\\nChatGPT’s unprecedented popularity, it is inevitable that ma-\\nlicious users will, if not already, attack ChatGPT by carefully\\ncrafting adversarial examples as its input. In this section,\\nwe present our analysis of ChatGPT’s reliability against ad-\\nversarial examples. These adversarial examples preserve the\\nsemantic meaning while allowing us to analyze ChatGPT’s\\nbehavior given varying degrees of perturbations.\\n6.1\\nThreat Model\\nAdversary’s Goals. Following previous work in adversarial\\nattacks [27, 37, 39, 48, 75], the adversary’s goal is to utilize\\nperturbed but semantic-preserving questions to elicit erro-\\nneous responses from ChatGPT. Ideally, the perturbed ques-\\ntions should satisfy the following criteria.\\n• Effectiveness. The perturbed questions should effec-\\ntively induce ChatGPT to generate wrong answers.\\n• Quality. The perturbed questions should maintain the\\nsemantic meaning and fluency of the original questions\\nwhile minimizing grammatical errors or modifications.\\n• Efficiency. The adversary should identify the perturbed\\nquestion that can achieve the desired effect with min-\\nimal queries, as ChatGPT’s API incurs a charge per\\nquery.\\nAdversary’s Capabilities. We assume that the adversary op-\\nerates in a real-world setting and has only limited capabili-\\nties. Specifically, the adversary is only able to query Chat-\\nGPT and has no access to the model weights, output proba-\\nbilities, hyperparameters, or configuration documents.\\n6.2\\nMethodology\\nDecision-Based Adversarial Attacks.\\nWe consider five\\ndecision-based adversarial attacks: VIPER [27], Nat [13],\\nSwap [13], Synonyms [15], and SCPN [37]. VIPER [27]\\nmodifies questions at the character level by replacing char-\\nacters with their nearest visual neighbors, e.g., “a” to “â.”\\nNat [13] collects naturally occurring errors, such as typos and\\nmisspellings, from available corpora and utilizes a look-up\\ntable for possible lexical replacements. Swap [13] introduces\\nartificial noises into questions by swapping letters among the\\nwords. Synonyms [15] generates adversarial examples by re-\\nplacing words with their synonyms based on predefined sub-\\nstitution rules. SCPN [37] is a sentence-level adversarial at-\\ntack that produces paraphrases of the target questions using\\na pre-trained model and syntax templates.\\nScore-Based Adversarial Attacks. We manually engineer a\\nprompt, namely leakage prompt, to induce ChatGPT to leak\\nthe confidence score for potential answer candidates. The\\nprompt consists of two restriction sentences for the answer,\\none sentence to explain the meaning of the confidence score\\nand a one-shot learning example to guide ChatGPT to gen-\\nerate output in an extractable format. The final version of\\nleakage prompt is:\\nQuestion: [Question]\\nOnly return your confidence score for each option. Do not\\nexplain. Higher means you think it’s more likely to be the\\ncorrect answer. For example, {“A”: 0.9, “B”: 0.1, “C”: 0.2,\\n“D”: 0.1}.”\\nAnswer: [MASK]\\nNote that in the leakage prompt, the sum of the confidence\\nscores is not necessarily equal to 1. We find this format to\\nbe more effective in eliciting ChatGPT’s confidence score\\nduring prompt design.\\nWe carefully verify that the con-\\nfidence scores obtained by leakage prompt match the cor-\\nrect answers (additional details are outlined in Section A.2).\\nConsequently, this leakage prompt enables us to measure\\nChatGPT’s resilience against score-based adversarial attacks.\\nWith the observation that character-level and sentence-level\\nattacks can achieve high attack success rates in most datasets\\nwhereas the word-level attack struggles to do so (see Ta-\\nble 5), we question whether this is due to the ChatGPT’s re-\\nliability towards word-level perturbations or the limitations\\nof the attack method itself.\\nIn our study, we then utilize\\nthe confidence scores to perform TextFooler [39], a repre-\\nsentative score-based word-level adversarial attack on Chat-\\nGPT. Specifically, given a target question, TextFooler con-\\nsists of two main steps. First, TextFooler identifies impor-\\ntant words with confidence scores. Then, TextFooler replaces\\nthem with the most semantically similar and grammatically\\ncorrect words until the response from ChatGPT is altered.\\n6.3\\nExperiment Settings\\nDataset. We randomly sample 65 correctly answered YN\\nand MC questions for the evaluation of adversarial exam-\\nples. These questions act as the ground truth since ChatGPT\\nresponds correctly without adversarial perturbation.\\nTarget Model.\\nWe consider ChatGPT instructed by the\\nExpert-CoT role as our target model. We choose this system\\nrole as it shows the best reliability in the previous evaluation\\n(see Section 5).\\nEvaluation Metrics. We employ seven metrics to assess the\\nthree aforementioned criteria. Effectiveness is measured by\\nAttack Success Rate. Quality is evaluated based on Lev-\\nenshtein Edit Distance, Fluency, Word Modification Rate,\\nSemantic Similarity, and Grammatical Errors. Efficiency is\\nassessed by examining the Number of Queries required to\\nachieve the intended results.\\n• Attack Success Rate (ASR). ASR represents the frac-\\ntion of adversarial examples that ChatGPT answers in-\\ncorrectly.\\n• Levenshtein Edit Distance (LED). The LED measures\\nthe minimum number of operations needed to transform\\nthe original text into the adversarial example.\\n• Fluency. Fluency measures the quality of the adversar-\\nial example, calculated by the perplexity metric.\\n• Word Modification Rate (WMR). The WMR is the\\npercentage of modified words in the adversarial exam-\\nple compared with the original question.\\n9\\n• Semantic Similarity. The semantic similarity measures\\nthe similarity between the original questions and adver-\\nsarial examples using Universal Sentence Encoder\\n• Grammatical Errors. The grammatical errors are the\\nnumber of errors in the adversarial example’s grammar\\nusing LanguageTool.7\\n• Number of Queries. The number of queries is the aver-\\nage number of queries on ChatGPT attempted to attain\\nthe attack goal. For all decision-based attacks, we re-\\nstrict the maximum query times to 10 per question.\\nWe also provide qualitative analysis to manually inspect the\\nreasons for the success of adversarial examples.\\n6.4\\nQuantitative Evaluation\\nEffectiveness. Table 5 shows the results of various adver-\\nsarial attacks on ChatGPT. Overall, we find that ChatGPT\\ncan be easily misled by existing adversarial attacks. Syn-\\nonyms attack is the only exception, as it has a considerably\\nlower ASR score compared to other attacks on the BoolQ\\ndataset. Our perturbation level analysis reveals that sentence-\\nlevel attacks, such as SCNP, usually yield higher ASR scores\\nthan character- and word-level attacks. This is evidenced by\\nsentence-level perturbation achieving an ASR score of 0.65\\non the CQA dataset, the highest among the three. This is as\\nexpected, as the sentence-level attack has more freedom to\\nmodify the target question (see Table 6).\\nAmong the three character-level attacks, we find Nat and\\nVIPER usually achieve higher ASR than Swap. This finding\\nimplies that ChatGPT exhibits proficiency in handling arti-\\nficial noises, but is less adept at coping with natural noises\\nand visual perturbations. Since natural noise and visual per-\\nturbations are prevalent in human-generated text, such as ty-\\npographical errors and slang terms, there is a need to further\\nenhance ChatGPT’s reliability to these challenges.\\nMoreover, we observe that Synonyms attack is ineffective\\nin most datasets, with an average ASR of 0.004. This result\\nsuggests that ChatGPT is proficient in recognizing and com-\\nprehending synonyms. However, when the adversary has ac-\\ncess to additional information from ChatGPT, i.e., utilizing\\nleakage prompt to conduct a more advanced attack, the av-\\nerage ASR increases to 0.38. This result highlights the se-\\nvere potential for advanced adversarial examples exploiting\\nChatGPT’s vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for further\\nresearch to enhance its security and privacy.\\nQuality. Overall, we find that word-level adversarial exam-\\nples achieve the best utility in most cases. In the case of the\\nCQA dataset, Synonyms and TextFooler achieve 0.93 and\\n0.76 semantic similarities. In contrast, VIPER, Swap, Nat,\\nand SCPN only achieve 0.22, 0.29, 0.37, and 0.68 seman-\\ntic similarities, respectively. This difference in quality is due\\nto the fact that word-level attacks replace words with syn-\\nonyms, which allows the questions to retain their semantics.\\nWe also find adversarial examples generated by VIPER are\\n7https://www.languagetool.org.\\nmore fluent than those generated by other methods. Specif-\\nically, VIPER achieves a perplexity score of 304.81 in the\\nBoolQ dataset, while Swap, Nat, Synonyms, TextFooler, and\\nSCPN have perplexity scores of 1286.87, 5936.50, 752.26,\\n1533.38, and 427.16, respectively. This finding highlights\\nthe importance of visual perturbation in achieving fluency.\\nEfficiency. We evaluate the efficiency of adversarial attacks\\nby analyzing the query number required for each method.\\nAs presented in Table 5, score-based adversarial attacks re-\\nquire a significantly higher number of queries than decision-\\nbased attacks. This is due to the fact that score-based at-\\ntacks need to interactively query ChatGPT to obtain the con-\\nfidence score for each word, which is then used to calcu-\\nlate the word’s importance. In contrast, different decision-\\nbased attacks have a similar number of queries to attain the\\nattack goal. The average query number on ARC is 8.00, 9.14,\\n8.14, 1.00, and 2.71 for VIPER, Swap, Nat, Synonyms, and\\nSCPN, respectively. It is worth noting that existing adver-\\nsarial attacks with high attack success rates still require sev-\\neral interactions with ChatGPT to find successful adversarial\\nexamples for a specific target question, except for YN tasks.\\nThis may serve as an indicator for the defender to proactively\\nidentify the adversaries and implement mitigation measures\\nbefore a successful adversarial example is found.\\n6.5\\nQualitative Analysis\\nBy manually inspecting ChatGPT’s answers to the adversar-\\nial examples, we find that adversarial examples lead Chat-\\nGPT to a wrong reasoning direction.\\nTable 6 shows one\\nrandomly sampled adversarial example. When asked by the\\nadversarial example “Brids caryring aawy furit hleps the\\ntere?” ChatGPT responds “The answer is (A) grow. Ex-\\nplanation: Birds play a crucial role in seed dispersal. When\\nthey eat fruits or berries, the seeds pass through their diges-\\ntive system ... then scattered and germinate in new places,\\nallowing for the growth and expansion of the plant species.\\nTherefore, birds carrying away fruit can help a tree to grow.”\\nWe notice that the last sentence recovers the original ques-\\ntion, indicating that ChatGPT can identify typographical er-\\nrors and rectify them. However, when looking at the explana-\\ntion, the adversarial example misleads ChatGPT’s perception\\nof a tree, i.e., conflating the concept of a tree with that of a\\nplant species. This results in incorrect reasoning, leading to\\nan incorrect answer.\\nWe are also surprised to find that ChatGPT’s perception\\ncan be affected by only one character in some cases. For in-\\nstance, when provided “birds carrying away fruit assists the\\ntree” (Synonyms attack), ChatGPT chooses the correct an-\\nswer (C) reproduce. However, once we modify “assists” to\\n“assist” (TextFooler attack), ChatGPT goes for (D) conquer.\\nFor the latter one, ChatGPT explains “Birds are known to\\ndisperse seeds by eating fruits and then excreting seeds in dif-\\nferent locations, which helps the tree to colonize new habitats\\nand expand its range to conquer new territories ...” This ex-\\nplanation shows the conflation of ChatGPT on the concept of\\na single tree with the plant species but ended in the conquer\\nperspective.

These results\\ndemonstrate the vulnerability of ChatGPT to adversarial at-\\ntacks and highlight the need for building safeguards to en-\\nhance its reliability.\\n7\\nDiscussion\\n7.1\\nSocial Implications\\nChatGPT’s reliability has emerged as a critical security con-\\ncern since its release. Numerous users have been misled by\\nChatGPT’s unreliable responses and resulted in significant\\nreal-life repercussions [22, 68, 72].\\nOur paper contributes\\nby providing, for the first time, a comprehensive large-\\nscale measurement of ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic\\nquestion-answering (QA) scenario. These findings have the\\n11\\nfollowing important social implications: 1) they help set\\nuser expectations regarding ChatGPT’s reliability; 2) they\\noffer valuable insights for researchers to improve its relia-\\nbility, such as fine-tuning ChatGPT on truthful law and sci-\\nence data. Moreover, we find 6.8% ChatGPT’s answers in-\\nclude hallucinatory facts. Although the ratio is low, consid-\\nering ChatGPT’s enormous usage, i.e., 1 billion queries per\\nday [1], a large amount of false information must have been\\ngenerated, read, and even unintentionally disseminated. How\\nto effectively identify and mitigate ChatGPT-generated false\\ninformation has become a critical problem that needs to be\\nurgently addressed.\\nAlso, the security issues of ChatGPT cannot be ignored.\\nOur study demonstrates that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adver-\\nsarial examples, with even a single character change in cer-\\ntain cases, thereby posing significant security risks. The po-\\ntential risks become increasingly magnified as ChatGPT con-\\ntinues to be integrated into numerous applications and gains\\naccess to users’ emails, social accounts, and private docu-\\nments [7, 8]. Therefore, ensuring robust security measures\\nshould be consideration in the development and deployment\\nof ChatGPT.\\n7.2\\nActionable Guidance\\nTo enhance ChatGPT’s reliability, we discuss actionable\\nguidance along the supply chain of ChatGPT, including data\\nquality, in-context learning, and post-processing interven-\\ntions.\\nData Quality. Improving the training data quality is a po-\\ntential avenue for enhancing ChatGPT’s reliability. As it is\\ntrained on a diverse range of sources, including web pages\\nand books [1], there is a possibility that the training data may\\ncontain contradictory or incorrect information, thus limiting\\nits reliability. Therefore, improving data quality for model\\ntraining can enhance the reliability of ChatGPT. However, it\\nis worth noting that building a high-quality training dataset\\nof such magnitude, i.e., approximately 300B words [1, 18],\\ncan pose significant challenges regarding computational re-\\nsources and associated costs.\\nIn-context Learning. In-context learning allows users to\\nprompt LLMs with instructions or demonstrations to solve\\na task without any additional training.\\nPrevious studies\\nhave shown that in-context learning can improve language\\nmodels’ performance by carefully selecting the demonstra-\\ntions [53]. Thus, it presents a straightforward approach for\\nusers to better utilize ChatGPT. However, in-context learn-\\ning also has its limitations. First, users are required to find\\nsuitable demonstrations before posing their questions, which\\ncan increase the overall usage cost and effort. Moreover, it\\nstill cannot fully address the inherent misknowledge inside\\nthe model.\\nPost-processing Interventions.\\nAnother approach to en-\\nhance ChatGPT’s reliability is to implement post-processing\\ninterventions for the output of the model. Currently, OpenAI\\nclaims it “may produce inaccurate information about people,\\nplaces, or facts” in the web interface of ChatGPT [4]. How-\\never, this statement alone is insufficient as it places the bur-\\nden of assessing the veracity of the information on the user.\\nProactive measures can be taken to address this limitation.\\nFor example, the model provider can deploy a false informa-\\ntion detector as part of a risk management solution to iden-\\ntify and flag potentially inaccurate or misleading responses.\\nOnce detected, they can guide users to verification resources,\\nsuch as fact-checking websites, credible news organizations,\\nor relevant government agencies.\\n7.3\\nLimitations\\nOur work has several limitations. First, we only consider En-\\nglish questions in our evaluation. However, ChatGPT’s relia-\\nbility may vary across different languages due to differences\\nin grammar, syntax, and culture. Furthermore, our study on\\nsystem roles only involves manually crafted roles. In real-\\nity, users can create versatile system roles, which may have\\nvaried impacts on ChatGPT’s reliability. Despite these lim-\\nitations, our study sheds light on the ChatGPT’s reliability\\nacross question domains, system roles, and adversarial at-\\ntacks.\\n8\\nRelated Work\\nEvaluation on Large Language Models. While large lan-\\nguage models (LLMs) have emerged as the foundation for\\nalmost all major language tasks, researchers have expressed\\nconcerns regarding their capability, robustness, consistency,\\nand potential risks [12, 14, 16, 38, 49, 59, 69, 71]. Bang et al.\\n[12] evaluate ChatGPT in traditional NLP tasks with 30 to\\n200 data samples for each task. They find ChatGPT is only\\ngood at language abilities rather than actual reasoning, which\\nmakes it an unreliable reasoner. Jang and Lukasiewicz [38]\\nstudy ChatGPT’s trustworthiness regarding logically consis-\\ntent behaviors and observe ChatGPT fails to generate logi-\\ncally correct predictions frequently. Wang et al. [69] con-\\nduct an assessment of ChatGPT’s robustness from the ad-\\nversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. They\\nfind ChatGPT shows consistent robustness on most classi-\\nfication tasks, but its performance is still far from perfec-\\ntion. Borji [16] empirical conclude 11 categories of Chat-\\nGPT’s failures, including reasoning, factual errors, math,\\ncoding, and so on.\\nIn addition to these functional con-\\ncerns, studies analyzing ChatGPT’s characteristics find that\\nit holds pro-environmental and left-libertarian political ide-\\nology [34], shows social stereotypes and unfair discrimina-\\ntion [43], and can be easily misled by the wrong knowledge\\npassed in the prompt [76]. Different from previous studies, in\\nthis paper, we focus on ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic\\nQA scenario. We not only build a larger and more compre-\\nhensive testbed, but also provide insights into question do-\\nmains, system roles, and adversarial attacks, which have not\\nbeen addressed by prior studies.\\nSecurity Risks of Large Language Models. Previous stud-\\nies have also shown that LLM is vulnerable to various types\\nof attacks, such as adversarial attacks [27, 30, 37, 39], back-\\ndoor attacks [11, 21], prompt injection [31, 57], obfusca-\\ntion [40], and data extraction attacks [19]. Bagdasaryan and\\nShmatikov [11] investigate meta-backdoor attacks that cause\\nthe language model to generate incorrect outputs with the\\n12\\ntrigger. Kang et al. [40] show that the defense of LLMs can\\nbe bypassed with classical security attacks such as obfusca-\\ntion, code injection, and virtualization. LLMs can be also\\nmisused for phishing [54], plagiarism [35, 66], misinforma-\\ntion generation [16], malicious code generation [56], and so\\non. The significant security risks posed by these works high-\\nlight the critical role of reliability in LLMs. In this paper, we\\naim to shed light on ChatGPT’s reliability in the generic QA\\nscenario. We hope our study can provide insights into the\\ncommunity and pave the way toward building reliable LLMs\\nin the future.\\n9\\nConclusion\\nThis paper presents the first large-scale measurement of\\nChatGPT’s reliability from three perspectives: 1) perfor-\\nmance in generic QA scenarios, 2) impacts of system roles,\\nand 3) its vulnerability to adversarial examples. Our find-\\nings indicate that ChatGPT’s reliability varies across differ-\\nent domains, with noticeable underperformance in law and\\nscience questions. We also, for the first time, systematically\\nexplore the impacts of system roles on ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity. We find that they not only steer ChatGPT’s behavior but\\nalso affect its reliability in ways that are not always evident\\nfrom the role description. We further assess ChatGPT’s reli-\\nability towards malicious inputs and find that sentence-level\\nand character-level adversarial examples can be effectively\\nmounted against ChatGPT. Our results provide insights to the\\nsecurity research community regarding ChatGPT’s reliabil-\\nity and highlight the need for developing reliable and secure\\nLLMs.\\nAcknowledgments.

CoRR abs/2302.13793, 2023. 1, 12\\nA\\nAppendix\\nA.1\\nDetailed Explanation of Datasets\\n• BoolQ [24] is a yes/no reading comprehension dataset.\\nThe questions are derived from aggregated Google\\nsearches. The answers (yes/no) are marked by human\\nannotators if certain Wikipedia pages contain sufficient\\ninformation to address the questions.\\n• OpenbookQA (OQA) [51] is a multiple-choice rea-\\nsoning dataset. The questions are derived from 1,326\\ncore science facts. The answers consist of 4 candidates,\\nof which only one is correct, requiring reasoning be-\\ntween questions and the given science facts and com-\\nmon knowledge.\\n• RACE [46] is a multiple-choice reading comprehension\\ndataset. The questions are derived from English exams\\nfor Chinese students. The answers include 4 candidates,\\nof which only one is correct, requiring reading compre-\\nhension of English passages.\\n• ARC [25] is a multiple-choice reasoning dataset. The\\nquestions are derived from science exams (student level\\nranging from 3rd grade to 9th) that are incorrectly an-\\nswered by retrieval-based and word co-occurrence al-\\ngorithms [25]. The answers consist of 4 candidates, of\\nwhich only one is correct, requiring decent knowledge\\nand reasoning in natural science.\\n• CommonsenseQA (CQA) [67] is a multiple-choice\\nreasoning dataset.\\nThe questions are derived from\\nknowledge encoded in ConceptNet [64]. The answers\\ncomprise 5 candidates, of which only one is correct, re-\\nquiring background knowledge that is trivial to humans\\nbut non-trivial to ML models’ reasoning capability.\\n• SQuAD1 [60] is an extractive reading comprehension\\ndataset. The questions are derived from Wikipedia ar-\\nticles. The answers should be extracted from the given\\ncontext (i.e., paragraphs) associated with the questions.\\n• SQuAD2 [59] combines questions in SQuAD1 with\\nunanswerable questions written by crowd workers. The\\nunanswerable questions resemble answerable ones but\\ncannot be found in the given context.\\n• NarrativeQA (NQA) [42] is an abstractive full docu-\\nment comprehension dataset. The questions are derived\\nfrom stories, such as books and movie scripts.\\nThe\\nanswers are human-generated free-form text using just\\nsummaries or the full story text.\\n• ELI5 [28] is an abstractive full document comprehen-\\nsion dataset. The questions are derived from the threads\\nin the “Explain Like I’m Five” (ELI5) subreddit (an on-\\nline community that provides answers to questions that\\nare comprehensible by five-year-olds). The answers are\\nfree-form text with the highest voting scores in those\\nthreads.\\n16\\nTable 7: Example of failure analysis with different system roles.\\nQuestion Which states are more obese than West Virginia\\nAnswer\\nNo states are more obese than West Virginia\\nW/o\\nAccording to recent studies, the states with higher obesity\\nrates than West Virginia include Mississippi, Arkansas,\\nKentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana ...\\nExpert-\\nCoT\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\\ntion (CDC) data, as of 2020, the following states have a\\nhigher percentage of obese adults (BMI of 30 or higher)\\nthan West Virginia, which has the highest obesity rate in\\nthe United States: 1. Mississippi, 2. Alabama ...\\nBad\\nBased on data from the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention (CDC), as of 2019, the following states have\\na higher percentage of adult obesity than West Virginia\\n(which has a rate of 35.6%): 1. Mississippi - 39.7%; 2.\\nAlabama - 36.2% ...\\n• TruthfulQA (TQA) [50] is an abstractive truthfulness\\ndataset.\\nIt was recently introduced to understand if\\nLLMs can avoid generating false answers learned from\\nimitating human texts. The questions, spanning 38 cat-\\negories (e.g., medicine, law, and finance), are single-\\nsentence questions and purposely designed so that some\\nhumans would answer wrongly due to a false belief or\\nmisconception. Each question has sets of true and false\\nreference answers and a source that supports the an-\\nswers.\\nA.2\\nEvaluation of Leakage Prompt\\nFigure 8 shows the confidence score distribution obtained\\nwith leakage prompt on correct-answer questions. We find\\nthe confidence score distribution meets our expectations. If\\nthe correct answer is (A), then option (A) should have the\\nhighest confidence score, which is also reflected in the plot.\\nThis evaluation proves the usability of leakage prompt.\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(a) Answer (A)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(b) Answer (B)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(c) Answer (C)\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n(d) Answer (D)\\nFigure 8: Confidence score distribution on correct-answer ques-\\ntions. The result for option (E) is not displayed since no question\\nhas (E) as the correct answer in the sample data.\\nA.3\\nImpacts of Question Fluency\\nWe also investigate the relationship between question flu-\\nency, ChatGPT answer fluency, and the corresponding cor-\\nrectness. Concretely, we measure the fluency of the gener-\\nated questions and answers using the perplexity (PPL) met-\\nric [58, 75]. A higher PPL indicates the sentence is less flu-\\nent. Figure 9a and Figure 10a in the Appendix displays the\\nbivariate distribution of questions and ChatGPT answer flu-\\nency. We exclude the EX task, as its answers are typically\\ntoo short for a representative perplexity score. Our analysis\\nreveals a positive correlation between question fluency and\\nChatGPT answer fluency, with a Pearson correlation coef-\\nficient of 0.1 (p < 0.1) in almost all datasets, except for the\\nBoolQ and TruthfulQA datasets. This suggests that ChatGPT\\ntends to answer in the same ambiguous way if a question is\\nless fluent. This, in turn, leads to unstable reliability, as illus-\\ntrated in Figure 9b and Figure 10b in the Appendix, where\\nwe see an increase in the standard variance (indicated by the\\nshadow area) as the question perplexity increases. However,\\nit is difficult to conclude whether higher question perplexity\\nresults in better or worse ChatGPT reliability, as we observe\\ndifferent tendencies across datasets.\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n101\\n102\\n103\\nAnswer PPL\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\n103\\nQuestion PPL\\n101\\n102\\nOQA (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n102\\n104\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n(a) Fluency distribution of questions and ChatGPT answers.\\nColor darkness represents the question count.\\n102\\n103\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nCorrectness (%)\\nBoolQ (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nOQA (Acc)\\n102\\n104\\nQuestion PPL\\n0\\n25\\n50\\n75\\n100\\nNQA (RougeL)\\n(b) Correctness distribution under fluency.

(Answer: No, the\\nvictim cannot drop the charges\\nonce a prosecutor is involved.)\\nYes, the victim of a domestic violence case can choose to drop the charges in\\nthe United States, but it is important to note that the decision to do so is often\\ncomplex and can have serious consequences. The decision to press charges\\nis ultimately up to the victim, but it is important to consider the safety and\\nwell-being of everyone involved. It may be a good idea to speak with a legal\\nprofessional or a domestic violence advocate before making a decision.\\nCasual\\nan-\\nswers\\nWhat are the advantages to ele-\\nphants in the wild according to\\nthe passage?\\n(A) They face\\nfewer problems.

A toaster converts electrical en-\\nergy into heat energy to toast bread, much like a campfire toasts bread. The\\nheat generated by the toaster is used to cook the bread, just as the heat from\\nthe campfire is used to cook the bread. Explanation: (A) “a campfire toasts\\nbread” is the correct answer because both a toaster and a campfire use heat to\\ncook food, in this case, toast bread. (B) “a microwave heats soup” is incorrect\\nbecause a microwave uses microwave radiation to heat food, not heat energy.\\n(C) “a fire burns paper” is incorrect because a fire is a chemical reaction that\\nreleases heat and light, not just heat. (D) “a small oven works” is incorrect\\nbecause an oven uses heat energy to cook food, but it is not specifically men-\\ntioned as toasting bread.\\nReferential\\nconfusion\\nLions and tigers will not kill or\\neat men _ . (A) unless men try to\\nrun away (B) if they are too old\\nand too weak (C) if they are able\\nto get enough food (D) however\\nmen act towards them (Answer:\\nC)\\nThe answer is (B) if they are too old and too weak. According to the article,\\nlions and tigers will only kill and eat men when they have grown too old and\\ntoo weak to catch their usual food, such as deer and other small animals.\\n19\\nTable 11: Four refusal reasons given by ChatGPT.

The release of ChatGPT [3] contributed to the widespread use\\nof AI-generated text tools while leading to concerns that the abuse of ChatGPT may bring misleading information,\\nphishing, and academic dishonesty [4]. Therefore, some studies [5] attempt to build detectors based on the pre-trained\\nlanguage model for ChatGPT-generated texts to prevent the abuse of the powerful ChatGPT.\\nHowever, detectors that perform well in intra-domain scenarios have poor robustness due to being easily attacked\\nby carefully designed strategies such as paraphrasing and polishing [6], which refers to the process of revising and\\nimproving the original text. Although retrieval [7] can help mitigate this problem, it still poses significant challenges,\\nsuch as high costs and lack of explanation. Moreover, as pointed out by the Association for Computational Linguistics\\n(ACL), it is necessary to establish a grading system for the degree to which large models participate in the paper\\ngeneration process 2.\\nIn order to identify ChatGPT-polished texts and provide users with more intuitive explanations, we create a novel\\ndataset called HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts instead of fully generated ones) for training a detector and\\nalso propose the Polish Ratio method which measures the degree of modification made by ChatGPT compared to the\\noriginal human-written text. Through experiments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model in accurately\\n∗Corresponding Author\\n2https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/ACL-2023-policy\\narXiv:2307.11380v2  [cs.CL]  30 Dec 2023\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nidentifying polished texts trained on our novel dataset. Moreover, our explanation method, the Polish Ratio, has shown\\npromising results on both our own dataset and other datasets that have not been seen before: there are significant distinct\\ndistributions in the predicted Polish Ratio of human-written, ChatGPT-polished, and ChatGPT-generated texts. Our\\ncontributions are: a) we build a Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstracT (HPPT) dataset, containing polished and\\noriginal paired abstracts with similarity measurements as the degree of polishing. b) We propose the Polish Ratio\\nto help explain the detection model indicating the modification degree of the text by ChatGPT. c) The experimental\\nresults show that our model performs better than other baselines on three datasets. The code and dataset are available:\\nhttps://github.com/Clement1290/ChatGPT-Detection-PR-HPPT.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nAlong with the appearance of large language models such as ChatGPT, some detection algorithms are proposed to\\nprevent the abuse of such powerful AI-generated text models. Recent detection methods can be roughly grouped\\ninto two categories [8]: white-box and black-box detectors. The white-box detector needs to access the distributed\\nprobability or vocabulary of the target language model, while the black-box detector only checks the output text of the\\ntarget model. Table 1 summarizes recent algorithms that detect ChatGPT-generated texts.\\nDetector\\nOpen Source\\nBlack Box\\nDetection basis\\nExplanation\\nDetectGPT\\n[9]\\n✓\\n✗\\nProbability Score\\n/\\nWatermarks\\n[10]\\n✓\\n✗\\nRed & Green Tokens\\n/\\nRoberta-based-detector\\n[5]\\n✓\\n✓\\nOutput String\\n/\\nOpenAI\\n[11]\\n✗\\n✓\\nOutput String\\n/\\nGPTZero\\n✗\\n✓\\nOutput String\\n/\\nDistilBERT-based-detector\\n[12]\\n✗\\n✓\\nOutput String\\nSHAP\\nOurs\\n✓\\n✓\\nOutput String\\nPolish Ratio\\nTable 1: Summary of recent algorithms detecting ChatGPT-generated texts.\\n[13] is a popular white-box detector, which takes advantage of the probability and entropy of the linguistic patterns,\\nwhile DetectGPT [9] utilizes the observation that ChatGPT texts tend to lie in areas where the log probability function\\nhas negative curvature to conduct zero-shot detection. Watermark-based detection methods [10, 14] need to divide the\\nvocabulary into a randomized set of words that is softly prompted to use during sampling (\"green\" tokens) and the\\nremaining words (\"red\" tokens), and modify the logits embedding when the model generates the results.\\nTraining another classifier as the detector with labeled data [11, 12, 5] is a mainstream black-box method. [5] finetunes\\nthe Roberta on the HC3 (Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus) dataset to obtain an effective detector. However, the\\nsimple ChatGPT-generated texts in the HC3 dataset make the model trained on it vulnerable to being attacked using the\\npolishing strategy, and the robustness is not ensured. Moreover, some effective detectors are not open-source and are\\ndirectly used for commercial operations, such as GPTZero 3 and OriginalityAI 4.\\nOn the other hand, the existing black-box detectors rarely provide explanations for the prediction. [15] proposed Local\\nInterpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and\\nfaithful manner by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. [16] proposed the SHapley Additive\\nexPlanations (SHAP) method to assign each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Although they\\nperform effectively on basic NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis [17], they do not provide a convincing explanation to\\nusers in ChatGPT detection task [12], compelling us to step forward and address this gap.\\n3https://gptzero.me/\\n4https://originality.ai/\\n2\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\n3\\nMethod\\nTo facilitate detecting ChatGPT-polished texts and offer more intuitive explanations to assist final judgment, we first\\ncollect human-written abstracts and polish all of them using ChatGPT forming Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired\\nabstracT (HPPT) dataset. Additionally, for each abstract pair in the dataset, we furnish three different similarity metrics\\n(Jaccard Distance, Levenshtein Distance, and BERT semantic similarity) between the human-written abstract and the\\ncorresponding abstract polished by ChatGPT. Based on the data, we train the Roberta model as the detector to conduct\\nthe detection task. Meanwhile, we also train the Polish Ratio model to explain the detection result to reveal the degree\\nof ChatGPT involvement. The overall detection process is shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: The study design of our detection method.\\n3.1\\nHPPT Dataset: Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstractT\\nSince the existing datasets are specifically designed for purely ChatGPT-generated detection, such as HC3 [5] and\\nignore the ChatGPT-polished texts, we first construct the Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstracT (HPPT) dataset.\\nSpecifically, we collect human-written abstracts of accepted papers from several popular NLP academic conferences\\nand polish all of them using ChatGPT 5. The texts in our dataset are paired, making it easy to observe the difference\\nbetween human-written and ChatGPT-polished texts. Overall, we collect 6050 pairs of abstracts and corresponding\\npolished versions from the ACL anthology (ACL, EMNLP, COLING, and NAACL) in the past five years (2018-2022):\\n2525 are from ACL, 914 are from EMNLP, 1572 are from COLING, and 1039 are from NAACL.\\nTo uncover the distinctions between human-written and ChatGPT-polished texts, we compute their similarities using\\nthree metrics: BERT semantic similarity6, Jaccard Distance, and Levenshtein Distance (details are presented in section\\n3.3). As shown in Figure 2, the paired texts are semantically similar in BERT semantic similarity, which shows it\\nis difficult to distinguish human-written and ChatGPT-Polished abstracts from BERT-based semantics. But Jaccard\\nDistance and Levenshtein Distance provide a better way to distinguish them as they align closely with the Gaussian\\ndistribution, making them suitable for measuring the degree of ChatGPT involvement.\\n3.2\\nDetection: Roberta-based black box model\\nFollowing the previous work [5], we treat the detection as a binary classification task and build a black-box detector\\nutilizing the Roberta model [19] because the model of ChatGPT is not accessible, as discussed in the Section 2. Unlike\\nthem, we regard the original abstract without polishing as human-written, and its corresponding ChatGPT polished\\nabstract is regarded as ChatGPT involved.\\n5The prompt is \"please polish the following sentences:<abstracts>\". We also tested the prompt \"please rewrite the following\\nsentences:<abstracts>\" and found that there is no big difference using \"polish\" or \"rewrite\". The differences of Levenshtein Distance\\nor Jaccard Distance between using “polish” and “rewrite” for most sample pairs are within the range of 0.1.\\n6BERT semantic similarity refers to the cosine similarity between two sentences’ embeddings using the BERT model. Here we\\nuse the SciBERT model [18].\\n3\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nJaccard Distance\\nLevenshtein Distance\\nBERT semantic similarity\\nFigure 2: Similarity distribution of polished abstracts in our HPPT dataset.\\n3.3\\nExplanation\\nDue to the black box nature of many existing detectors, they are unable to provide explanations that are crucial for\\ndifferentiating ChatGPT-Polished text. Therefore, we employ two independent explanation methods GLTR (Giant\\nLanguage model Test Room) and Polish Ratio (PR). This approach is favored over posterior explanation methods such\\nas SHAP, ensuring more comprehensive justifications for our final judgments.\\n• GLTR: Giant Language model Test Room [13] is a statistical method used for AI-generated text detection\\n(mainly for GPT-2). It assumes that human-written text uses a wider subset of the distribution under a model.\\nAlthough it was initially designed for GPT-2-generated text detection, we formulate a hypothesis that the\\ndistribution of GPT-2 and ChatGPT-generated texts is similar in some way since both are AI-generated texts. It\\nuses three criteria to help detection: (1) The probability of the word, as shown in Equation 1; (2) The absolute\\nrank of a word that is the rank of the Equation 1; (3) The entropy of the predicted distribution, as shown in\\nEquation 2.\\nProbi = pdet(Xi|X1:i−1)\\n(1)\\nEntropyi = −\\nX\\nw\\npdet(Xi = w|X1:i−1)log(pdet(Xi = w|X1:i−1))\\n(2)\\nSpecifically, if a text is written by a human, a word should have a low probability, which leads to a higher top\\nrank and the entropy also should be large.\\nWe consider the GLTR as our baseline for the explanation method as we have discovered that the method is\\neffective in explaining the distinction between human-written and entirely ChatGPT-generated texts. However,\\nit fails to provide adequate explanations when ChatGPT-polished texts are present (refer to Section 4.3 for\\nfurther details). To address this issue, we adopt a new method called the Polish Ratio.\\n4\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\n• PR: Polish Ratio is a new metric we propose to measure the degree of ChatGPT involvement for a text. It\\nmeasures the degree of text modification before and after revision using ChatGPT by calculating the similarity\\nscore between original human-written texts and the corresponding polished texts. In our dataset HPPT, we\\ntake two metrics Jaccard Distance and Levenshtein Distance (Levenshtein Distance is normalized by the\\nmaximum length of the two sequences) as the Polish Ratio. Since ChatGPT generates the text using tokens,\\nwe evaluate the distances based on white-space tokenized words. As shown in Equation 3, Jaccard distance\\nmeasures the dissimilarity between sets by comparing the size of their intersection and union. Levenshtein\\ndistance measures the difference between two sequences by counting the minimum number of edits (deletion,\\ninsertion, and substitution), as shown in Equation 4.\\nJ(A, B) = 1 −|A ∩B|\\n|A ∪B|\\n(3)\\nWhere:\\n– A, B are the set of words in the document text strings.\\n– | · | represents the cardinality (number of elements) of the set.\\nlev(a, b) =\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f3\\nmax(|a|, |b|) if min(|a|, |b|) = 0\\nmin\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nlev(a[2 :], b[2 :]) + 1,\\nlev(a[2 :], b[1 :]) + 1,\\nlev(a[1 :], b[2 :]) + 1\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\uf8feotherwise\\n(4)\\nWhere:\\n– a, b represent a list of white-space tokenized words in the document.\\n– | · | represents the length of the word list.\\n– lev(a[i :], b[j :]) represents the Levenshtein distance between the sublist of a starting at index i and b\\nstarting at index j.\\nTherefore, we regard the PR model as the regression model where either the Jaccard distance or normalized\\nLevenshtein distance of the polished texts is the target value of the Polish Ratio. In ideal conditions, the\\npredicted PR value of an abstract should approach 0 for a human-written one and should be close to 1 when\\nChatGPT revises a majority of words in the abstract. We use the Roberta-based model to extract feature\\nxi ∈R768 of each sentence i and use an MLP to conduct the final regression task. The sigmoid function is\\nchosen as the activation function to ensure the range of the regression result is in [0, 1]. Compared to other\\nexplanation indices like confidence level, our PR method takes advantage of the paired abstracts before and\\nafter polishing to measure how much the ChatGPT involvement is, which can give a more independent and\\nconvincing explanation.\\n4\\nExperiment and analysis\\n4.1\\nExperiment Setup\\n4.1.1\\nDataset\\nWe conduct experiments on the following three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.\\n• HPPT\\nIt is our built ChatGPT-polished dataset, which consists of 6050 pairs of recent abstracts and corresponding\\npolished versions. Meanwhile, to measure the degree of ChatGPT involvement in the text, we also provide\\nthe Levenshtein distance and Jaccard distance of the polished abstracts compared with their corresponding\\nhuman-written ones as the labeled PR value and label 0 as the PR value of those human-written abstracts. We\\nrandomly partition the HPPT into the train, test, and validation sets by 6 : 3 : 1 to train and test our model\\n(Roberta-HPPT).\\n• HC3 [5]\\nThe HC3 (Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus) dataset7 is one of the most popular ChatGPT detection\\ndatasets containing question-answering QA pairs. The human answers are collected from publicly available\\n7https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3/tree/main\\n5\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts? Measure the Polish Ratio to Detect ChatGPT-Generated Text\\nquestion-answering datasets and wiki text, while the answers provided by ChatGPT are obtained from its\\npreview website through manual input of questions for each interaction. We choose its English version corpus,\\nwhich consists of 85,449 QA pairs (24,322 questions, 58,546 human answers, and 26,903 ChatGPT answers).\\nWe randomly partition the HC3 into the train, test, and validation sets by 6 : 3 : 1 and regard the answer text\\nas the input of our detection model to ensure the detector’s versatility. In addition, it is also used to train our\\nbaseline model (Roberta-HC3).\\n• CDB [20]\\nThe ChatGPT-Detector-Bias Dataset8 (CDB) is a mixed dataset consisting of 749 text samples derived from\\nhuman, ChatGPT and GPT-4. The human data is from TOEFL essays in a Chinese educational forum, US\\nCollege Admission essays, and scientific abstracts from Stanford’s course CS224n. The GPT data consists of\\nsamples polished by both ChatGPT and GPT-4, as well as essays fully generated by ChatGPT using different\\nprompts. We also take it as the harder dataset to test the detectors’ generalization ability because it not only\\ncontains the GPT-4-generated or GPT-4-polished text but also contains well-designed prompt engineering\\nChatGPT-generated text and the human writing samples from both native and non-native English writers.\\n4.1.2\\nReproduction details\\nDuring training our detection model, we use the batch size 16, learning rate 2e −5 and the maximum epoch is set to 10.\\nThe model is chosen as the best one on the validation set. While training our PR model, we use batch size 4, learning\\nrate 1e −5, and the maximum epoch is set to 15.\\n4.2\\nDetection Result\\nTable 2 shows several baselines and our model performance on three datasets. Our model performs well on both\\nin-domain dataset HPPT and out-of-domain datasets (HC3 and CDB), suggesting that our model trained on the polished\\nHPPT dataset is more robust than other models. Although the Roberta-HPPT model is only trained on HPPT, it achieves\\ncomparable performance compared to the SOTA model in HC3, with only a 3% difference and better than DetectGPT.\\nOn the more difficult dataset (CBD), our model significantly outperforms other baselines with 88.15% accuracy.\\nSpecifically, our model only drops 6% on the out-of-domain dataset while the Roberta-HC3 and the DetectGPT drop by\\nnearly 40%, demonstrating the strong robustness of our model. The reason is that our model is trained on the ChatGPT-\\npolished text instead of ChatGPT-generated text, which can tackle more difficult samples such as GPT-4-generated,\\nGPT-4-polished, and well-designed prompt engineering ChatGPT-generated texts.\\nTest\\nDataset\\nACC\\nAUROC\\nHPPT\\nHC3\\nCDB\\nHPPT\\nHC3\\nCDB\\nGPTZero\\n-\\n-\\n0.4406\\n-\\n-\\n0.6818\\nOpenAI-GPT-2\\n-\\n-\\n0.4633\\n-\\n-\\n0.5604\\nOriginalityAI\\n-\\n-\\n0.4967\\n-\\n-\\n0.5721\\nDetectGPT\\n0.5129\\n0.8309\\n0.4593\\n0.6876\\n0.9058\\n0.7308\\nRoberta-HC3\\n0.5285\\n0.9991\\n0.5848\\n0.7946\\n1\\n0.7526\\nRoberta\\n-HPPT (ours)\\n0.9465\\n0.9671\\n0.8825\\n0.9947\\n0.9931\\n0.9518\\nTable 2: The detection performance of some popular detection models.

Motivated by this, we adopt two explanation methods (GLTR and Polish\\nRatio) to measure them.\\n4.3.1\\nGLTR\\nFigure 3 shows the visualization of the probability, absolute rank, and the distribution’s entropy of two pairs of\\ntexts from HC3 and HPPT.

A word that ranks within the top 10 probability is highlighted in green, top 100 in yellow, top 1,000 in\\nred, and the rest in purple. Sample 1 and Sample 2 are chosen from the HC3 test set, while Sample 3 and Sample 4 are\\nchosen from the HPPT test set.\\ntop-ranked probability generated by the LLM system. Comparing samples 1 and 2, we find that the difference between\\nhuman-written and ChatGPT-generated texts is noticeable. Texts entirely generated by ChatGPT prefer to use those\\ntop-rank probability words, which validates our hypothesis in Section 3.3. However, it is relatively hard to distinguish\\nhuman-written and ChatGPT-polished texts, as illustrated in samples 3 and 4. The reason is that the fraction of top-rank\\nprobability words employed in polished texts decreases significantly, approaching that of human-written texts. As a\\nresult, the GLTR explanation mechanism proves challenging in this scenario.\\n4.3.2\\nPolish Ratio Regression\\nTherefore, we propose Polish Ratio to explain the detection result of both entirely ChatGPT-generated and ChatGPT-\\npolished texts. As shown in Table 3, we try Jaccard distance and Levenshtein distance as the true label of the Polish Ratio\\nrespectively. Considering the influence of outliers and the unbalanced samples because of 0 PR ones (human-written\\nabstracts), we try different loss functions to test their effectiveness. Suppose the target value for the Polish Ratio of each\\ntext sample i is yi and the predicted value is ˆyi, the different losses ℓi for sample i are defined as:\\nL1(yi, ˆyi) = |yi −ˆyi|\\n(5)\\nSmoothL1(yi, ˆyi) =\\n\\x1a0.5 · (yi −ˆyi)2\\nif |yi −ˆyi| < β\\n|yi −ˆyi| −0.5 · β\\notherwise\\n(6)\\nLMSE(yi, ˆyi) = (yi −ˆyi)2\\n(7)\\nwhere L1 is L1-loss, SmoothL1 is smooth L1-loss and LMSE is the mean square error while the loss for all N samples\\nis calculated as ℓ(y, ˆy) = 1\\nN\\nPN\\ni=1 ℓi. Through the experiment, we find that MSE is the best choice.\\n7\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts?

It not only effectively distinguishes between human-written\\nand polished texts but also successfully discriminates ChatGPT-generated texts that are not encountered during the\\ntraining stage. While both Jaccard distance and Levenshtein distance serve as suitable PR metrics to differentiate the\\nCP and CG groups, the use of Levenshtein distance proves to be more effective, where the median Polish Ratio of\\nChatGPT-polished texts is around 0.5, while that of ChatGPT-generated texts is around 0.65. According to the violin\\nplot shown in Figure 4b, we suggest a Polish Ratio greater than 0.2 indicates ChatGPT involvement, and a value greater\\nthan 0.6 indicates that ChatGPT generates most words.\\n4.4\\nCase study for Polish Ratio\\nOur Polish Ratio is also accurate in the case study. Table 4 is the case study of the Polish Ratio regression on the index\\nLevenshtein Distance. Indeed, it can effectively differentiate the extent of modification introduced by ChatGPT. For\\ninstance, the degree of text modification by ChatGPT varies significantly between text (1b) and text (2b), as highlighted\\nin red, leading to a notable difference in their PR values, which proves the effectiveness of our PR method.\\n4.5\\nError Analysis\\nWe conduct an error analysis to gain insights into our model’s learning process and assess the efficacy of our explanation\\nmethods. We focus on understanding the reasons behind the mistakes the baseline model and our model made in the\\nHPPT dataset, shown in Table 5.\\nThe result shows that the baseline model only trained on the purely ChatGPT-generated text exhibited confusion when\\nencountering a polishing attack, as evidenced by the classification of nearly all polished samples as human-written. In\\ncontrast, our model (Roberta-HPPT) tends to make mistakes for originally human-written texts, as shown in Table 5.\\nBy exploring the Polish Ratio of these misclassified samples, we find misclassified samples have a relatively high PR\\nwhich originally should be close to 0 PR for human-written samples, as shown in Figure 5. This discovery indicates\\nthat our PR method can explain the reasons why the detection model makes mistakes: the writing style of original\\nhuman-written texts may be similar to that of ChatGPT.\\n8\\nIs ChatGPT Involved in Texts?

We collect 1,232\\nabstracts from the CSL: a large-scale Chinese Scientific Literature dataset [22] that contains 396,209 Chinese papers’\\nmeta-information including title, abstract, keywords, academic category and discipline. Then we use ChatGPT to polish\\n9 the selected 1,232 Chinese abstracts and calculate the Jaccard Distance and Levenshtein Distance (normalized) between\\nthe polished and the corresponding human-written abstract based on Chinese characters. The 1,232 pairs of abstracts are\\nrandomly partitioned into the train, test, and validation sets by 6 : 3 : 1.

Emblematic of this revolution is ChatGPT, a tool that has rapidly and \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2 \\nprofoundly infiltrated our lives, transforming everything from the labor market to the landscape of \\nscientific publishing (Bertolo & Antonelli, 2023; Ghassemi et al., 2023; Kaiser, 2023; Nature \\nCancer , 2023; Noy & Zhang, 2023). A global survey by Nature, involving 1600 researchers, \\nunderlines this paradigm shift, revealing that a majority view AI tools as \\'very important\\' or \\n\\'essential\\' for their research in the coming decade. Recognizing ChatGPT\\'s extensive impact across \\nvarious scientific disciplines, Nature has acknowledged it as one of the most influential entities in \\nscience for the year 2023 (Noorden & Webb, 2023.; Van Noorden & Perkel, 2023). \\nBy harnessing vast amounts of human-generated data, such as the Internet, ChatGPT has \\nexhibited remarkable capabilities in activities ranging from coding to creative writing, often \\nsurpassing human performance. Empirical evidence suggests that ChatGPT is instrumental in \\nreducing labor market inequalities, enabling workers of varied skills to enhance productivity \\nsignificantly (Noy & Zhang, 2023). Remarkably, in realms traditionally considered exclusive to \\nhuman ingenuity—like literature, music, and art—generative AI tools have demonstrated \\nextraordinary prowess (Nature Machine Intelligence, 2022; Epstein et al., 2023; Rafner, Beaty, \\nKaufman, Lubart, & Sherson, 2023). ChatGPT, for instance, has not only matched human creativity \\nin various tests but has also been instrumental in amplifying it, heralding a new era of human-AI \\nco-creativity (Folk, 2023; Jia, Luo, Fang, & Liao, 2023; Koivisto & Grassini, 2023; Rafner et al., \\n2023). \\nHowever, this technological marvel is not without its detractors. Concerns range from \\nexacerbating biases and privacy breaches to perpetuating misinformation (Acion, Rajngewerc, \\nRandall, & Etcheverry, 2023; Bockting, Van Dis, Van Rooij, Zuidema, & Bollen, 2023; Choudhury, \\n2023; Kidd & Birhane, 2023; Porsdam Mann et al., 2023). A particularly salient issue is the \\npotential for content homogenization, as researchers and creators increasingly rely on AI tools \\ntrained on uniform databases (Nakadai, Nakawake, & Shibasaki, 2023; Wong & C, 2023). While \\nthis may initially facilitate information dissemination and spark imagination, it could, over time, \\nhinder the diversity of thought crucial for groundbreaking innovations. This paradox places \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3 \\nresearchers at a crossroads, exhilarated by the transformative capabilities of tools like ChatGPT, \\nyet cautious of their far-reaching implications. \\n1.1  Research questions and significance \\nAs generative AI continues to evolve, the extent to which we should allow it to permeate our \\nscientific work, and the degree to which we should permit opaque algorithms to replace our creative \\nactivities, are pressing questions needing answers (Acion et al., 2023; Jo & A, 2023; Nakadai et al., \\n2023). To address these, we need to delve deeper into three key questions. Research Question1: \\nWhile using ChatGPT for creative activities may seem to enhance our performance in the short \\nterm, what are the long-term impacts of its use in creative work? Research Question2: What \\nhappens to our creative behavior if we become overly reliant on ChatGPT for co-creativity and \\nthen suddenly lose access to it? In other words, is the creativity augmented by ChatGPT genuine? \\nResearch Question3: Does ChatGPT hinder innovation, leading to a homogenization of ideas and \\npossibly resulting in a loss of scientific diversity? \\nThe advent of generative AI, akin to opening Pandora\\'s Box, presents a complex landscape of \\nopportunities and challenges. While AI assistance offers manifold benefits, it also represents a \\ndouble-edged sword, necessitating a careful balance between leveraging its advantages and \\nmitigating its risks. \\nTo investigate the three research questions, this study enrolled 61 university students, \\nrandomly allocating them into an independent group or a ChatGPT-assisted group, for a \\ncomprehensive seven-day lab experiment followed by a one-month follow-up survey. Over the \\ncourse of the study, they engaged in 16 diverse creative tasks, generating a robust dataset of 3302 \\nideas and 427 solutions. Specifically, participants were tasked with completing two types of \\ncreative assignments each day, either independently or with the aid of ChatGPT. The first task was \\na low-complexity alternative uses test (AUT) with a three-minute time limit, and the second, a \\nhigh-complexity task involving the addition of new features to a product for a company, requiring \\nsolution proposals. This long-term laboratory study aimed to explore the impact of prolonged use \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4 \\nof ChatGPT on individual continuous innovation capabilities, compared to completing creative \\ntasks independently. We focused particularly on how people\\'s innovative performances would \\nchange if they suddenly lost access to ChatGPT, having become overly dependent on it for creative \\ntasks. Compared to the independent completion group, does the use of ChatGPT lead to a \\nconvergence in people\\'s overall ideas, and does this convergence persist even after the removal of \\nChatGPT? In essence, we sought to investigate whether prolonged use of ChatGPT enhances \\ncreativity but leads to more homogenized content, and whether such enhancements in creativity \\nand homogenization persist in future creative activities after ChatGPT is no longer used. \\n2  Method: One-week-experimental design  \\n2.1  Participants \\nSixty-one college students (Mage = 21.56 years, SD = 2.62) with 31 different majors from a \\nuniversity completed the lab experiment (per-registered at https://osf.io/hea8r). 36 of them were \\nfemale. Participants were invited to complete a series of lab experiment that last for a week without \\nintervals. After consenting to the study, they were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: \\nChatGPT use (the treatment group, n = 31) and no ChatGPT use (the control group, n = 30).  \\n2.2  Materials and procedure \\nTo capture the full picture of creativity, we adopted 14 different creative tasks to measure \\nparticipant’s divergent thinking and convergent thinking, two critical yet distinct pathway to \\ncreativity. Whereas divergent thinking involves the generation of multiple ideas in diverse \\ndirections (e.g., listing the unusual uses for a pen, Guilford, 1967), convergent thinking involves \\nidentifying the best solution to a clearly defined problem (e.g., Duncker’s candle problem; Duncker, \\n1945).  \\nAll participants were asked to complete two types of creativity tasks each day: a low-\\ncomplexity task (AUT: generating alternative uses for a product) and a high-complexity task \\n(Come up with innovative function points and propose solutions for the products developed in the \\nenterprise). In the first AUT task, participants had a maximum of 3 minutes to list creative uses for \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\neveryday objects, such as a pen or a brick. Then, the experimenter would ask the participants to \\nfind the best way to solve a real-life problem (Task 2), such as developing new functions for a VR \\nglasses. For task 2, there is no time limited. The orders of tasks were counter-balanced. \\nIn the first day and the last day, all participants were invited to finish the same two creative \\ntasks without any ChatGPT assistance. We did so to make sure there was no significant difference \\non baseline creativity (Day1). More importantly, we were curious about whether there was a \\nremaining manipulated impacts of ChatGPT use experiences on creativity performance (Day7).  \\nWe manipulated the ChatGPT use experiences during the middle 5 days (from Day 2 to Day \\n6). We provided half of the participants (the treatment group) ChatGPT 4.0 to help them to finish \\nthe creative tasks, while the other half still finished the same two creative tasks by themselves (the \\ncontrol group). The flow of experimental design was depicted in Figure 1. \\nFigure1 Experimental Design \\n \\n2.3  Creativity code and assessment  \\nTwo experimenters were trained to code the text content. For AUT task, we extracted \\nindependent ideas from the text content. Preliminary analysis showed that participants came up \\nwith at least 351 (Day 7) to maximum 501 (Day 4) ideas per day, averaged at 5.75 ideas per person. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\nFor problem-solving task, we remained all their answers. We randomized the order in a spreadsheet \\nwithout any identifying information.  \\nWe had four (two for each task) coders who were blind to the study purposes and experimental \\nconditions rate participants’ responses, adherent to the consensual assessment technique (CAT, \\nAmabile, 1996). We provided raters with the spreadsheet and instructed them to evaluate each idea \\nin it.  \\nAssessment on divergent thinking. In AUT tasks, two raters were instructed to independently \\nrate participants’ each idea in terms of novelty (i.e., the originality of the idea) and usefulness (i.e., \\nthe practicality of the idea). The interrater reliabilities for both aspects were satisfactory (ICCs \\n≥ .90). Participants’ level of novelty and usefulness was respectively computed by summing the \\nscores of each idea. Flexibility of each participant was subjective and was obtained by counting \\nthe total number of unique usage categories. Besides, we asked participants to select the most \\ncreative idea when they complected the AUT task. So, we computed participants’ self-recognition \\naccuracy by subtracting the score of the selected idea from the maximum score of this participant.  \\nAssessment on convergent thinking. In problem-solving task, another two raters who had \\nrich work experiences on new project development were instructed to independently rate \\nparticipants’ responses in four different ways: (1) creativity (i.e., the novel and useful level of idea); \\n(2) content quality (i.e., the writing, structures, and logics of the idea), (3) public popularity (i.e., \\nprediction on customer’s favor if the idea was implemented), (4) market success (i.e., prediction \\non product success if the idea was implemented). The interrater reliabilities for all aspects were \\nsatisfactory (ICCs ≥ .90). \\n3  Results \\n3.1  The impact of ChatGPT use on creativity performance  \\nBaseline test. Based on the results of Day 1, there was no significant differences on creativity \\nperformance between two groups, implying that all participants’ creativity were similar.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\nThe manipulated effects of ChatGPT use on everyday creative tasks. According to the results \\nof Day 2 to Day 6, participants in the ChatGPT condition performed superior to those in the control \\ncondition. To be specific, participants with the help of ChatGPT generated more novel, useful, and \\nflexible usages in the AUT tasks. What is more, when asked to solve a real-life problem, they also \\ncame up with more creative and highly valuable ideas with more potential to gain public favor and \\nmarket success. \\nHowever, we found that ChatGPT failed to help participant to recognize the most creative \\nidea in AUT task, as we observed no significant difference on novelty and usefulness recognition \\naccuracy between two groups.  \\nThe effects of ChatGPT on sustained creativity. Based on the results of Day 7, in which all \\nparticipants completed the creative tasks without any ChatGPT assistance, participants who used \\nChatGPT in the last five days showed a sharp decrease in both divergent thinking and convergent \\nthinking. Specifically, they did not perform better in all kinks of creativity, such as novelty, \\nusefulness, flexibility, content quality, possible public favors, and market success, compared to the \\nparticipants in control group (all p-values were insignificant). One month later (label as Day 30), \\nin the follow-up survey where participants were invited to complete another AUT task (i.e., sponge), \\nwe repeated the findings that there was no significant difference on creativity in terms of novelty, \\nusefulness, and flexibility between participants from the treatment versus control group. Taken \\ntogether, we concluded that although ChatGPT helps people excel in creative tasks, people’s \\ncreativity could not sustain but fall back to the average level once they did not have ChatGPT to \\nrely on.  \\nWe utilized the R packages broom and dplyr for conducting t-tests to compare differences \\nbetween the treatment and control groups. For data visualization, the ggplot2 package was \\nemployed. The results of creative scores are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. The visualization of \\nthese results can be found in Figures 2a and 2b (Only parts related to novelty and usefulness in \\nFigure 2a and 2b are shown; see appendix for the rest..). \\n \\n \\n \\n

In another words, we \\nwere interested to know whether participant with the help from ChatGPT generated more creative \\nbut less diverse responses. If it is true, we would further explore whether this impact would remain \\neven they did not use ChatGPT in the future creative tasks (i.e., Day 7 and Day 30 in this study). \\nWe mainly relied on Machine Learning and the Natural Language Processing technology to \\nestimate the homogeneity of participants’ responses.  \\nUsing SBERT for text semantic similarity calculation. Sentence-BERT (Sentence-\\nBidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers, shorten as SBERT) is an improved \\nmodel based on BERT, designed to better handle sentence-level embeddings (Reimers & \\nGurevych, 2019). Unlike the original BERT model, which encodes individual words, SBERT \\nencodes entire sentences, providing a richer semantic representation. This feature gives SBERT a \\nsignificant advantage in tasks requiring understanding of the entire sentence semantics, such as text \\nsimilarity calculation.  \\nTo use SBERT for text semantic similarity, we first trained the SBERT model. During training, \\nthe model learns semantic relationships between a large number of sentences. Once trained, we \\nused this model to encode sentences from creative texts, obtaining their semantic representations \\n(sentence embedding). Then, we calculated the cosine similarity between these semantic \\nrepresentations of the creative texts to determine their similarity. For example, with two answer \\n\"S1\" and \"S2\", we first encoded them using the SBERT model to obtain two sentences embedding \\n\"Embed1\" and \"Embed2\". We then calculated the cosine similarity between \"Embed1\" and \\n\"Embed2\" as the similarity between \"S1\" and \"S2\". The formula for cosine similarity is as follows: \\ncos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| ||B||) \\nA and B are two sentences embedding, \"·\" denotes the dot product of the vectors, and \"||A||\" \\nand \"||B||\" are the lengths (or norms) of vectors A and B, respectively. During the calculation, we \\nfirst computed the dot product of sentence embedding A and B, then calculated the norms of \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\nsentence embedding A and B, and finally divided the dot product by the product of the norms, \\nresulting in the cosine similarity.  \\nThe flow of SBERT was presented in Figure 3. \\nFigure3 \\nBased on the results of Day 1 using SBERT, we found that all participants shared a heterogeneous \\nresponse towards to the tasks (the similarity of MC = 0.36, the similarity of ME = 0.35, n.s). \\nHowever, the knowledge diversity became lost when some of them began to use ChatGPT to \\ngenerate answers (the similarity of MC = [0.3, 0.48], the similarity of ME = [0.35, 59], ps ≤ .01), \\nand it remained a decreasing trend in one month later (the similarity of MC = 0.33, the similarity of \\nME = 0.39, p ≤ .001), in which they did not use ChatGPT to complete the creative tasks at all. As \\na comparison, we did not find the same pattern in participants who did not use ChatGPT during the \\nwhole study. To cross-validate the findings, we also used String Matching algorithm to compute \\nthe common string in the context, another index to reflect the context similarity.  \\nUsing String Matching for text redundancy calculation. String matching was implemented \\nthrough a series of algorithms that can identify and compare common character sequences between \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\ntwo texts. We used string matching techniques to assess the redundancy between two creative texts. \\nThis method is widely used in academia to detect plagiarism in papers. Our goal was to determine \\nthe \"literal\" similarity between creative texts, which was achieved by identifying identical string \\nsequences in two answers.  \\nIn this study, we employed an improved String Matching Technique that compares not only \\nindividual characters but also considers the sequence of characters in a string. Our algorithm first \\nconverted the two creative texts “S1” and “S2” into separate strings and then searched for repeated \\nsequences longer than two characters. This method helped to exclude accidental or insignificant \\nmatches, thereby increasing the accuracy of redundancy assessment. The calculation process \\nincludes several key steps: 1) Preprocessing: Convert “S1” and “S2” into a standard format to \\nensure consistency. 2) Match Searching: Search for repeated strings longer than two characters in \\nboth sentences. 3) Redundancy Calculation: Calculate the mean of repeated strings for a task. We \\nfound that by considering strings longer than two characters, we can effectively assess the \\nredundancy rate between the two creative texts “S1” and “S2”, while avoiding overemphasis on \\nshort, common phrases. This method provided a more precise framework for understanding the \\nsubstantive similarity between two sentences. \\nThe results of Day 1 showed that there was a relatively low rate of common strings towards to \\nthe tasks (the redundancy of MC = 0.36, the redundancy of ME = 0.35, n.s). However, in the next \\nfive days when participants used ChatGPT to generate answers, their responses shared a larger rate \\nof common strings than the participants who did not use the ChatGPT (the redundancy of MC = \\n[3.13, 3.4], the redundancy of ME = [5.90, 8.73], ps ≤ .01). So, the knowledge homogeneity caused \\nby ChatGPT use was repeated.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\nTable 3 Results of similarity and redundancy of the context \\n \\nSBERT \\nString \\nMatching \\n \\nSBERT \\nString Matching \\nTASK1 Control GPT Control GPT TASK2 Control GPT Control GPT \\nDay 1 \\n0.36 \\n0.35 \\n3.44 \\n3.51 \\nDay 1 \\n0.59 \\n0.58 \\n70.4 \\n64.5 \\nDay 2 \\n0.39 \\n0.48 \\n2.73 \\n5.9 \\nDay 2 \\n0.51 \\n0.62 \\n55.82 \\n215.31 \\nDay 3 \\n0.32 \\n0.48 \\n3.17 \\n8.24 \\nDay 3 \\n0.69 \\n0.83 \\n57.65 \\n214.57 \\nDay 4 \\n0.3 \\n0.45 \\n3.33 \\n7.12 \\nDay 4 \\n0.57 \\n0.62 \\n52.41 \\n203.87 \\nDay 5 \\n0.48 \\n0.59 \\n3.4 \\n8.73 \\nDay 5 \\n0.55 \\n0.72 \\n63.71 \\n195.38 \\nDay 6 \\n0.38 \\n0.53 \\n3.13 \\n7.95 \\nDay 6 \\n0.63 \\n0.69 \\n63.57 \\n209.03 \\nDay 7 \\n0.33 \\n0.36 \\n2.76 \\n3.74 \\nDay 7 \\n0.6 \\n0.62 \\n54.74 \\n75.28 \\nDay30 \\n0.33 \\n0.39 \\n1.45 \\n2.34 \\nDay30 \\n/ \\n/ \\n/ \\n/ \\nNote: Numbers in bold are not significant, while the rests are significant (p ≤ .001). \\nTo visualize the above findings, we utilized the SBERT technology to generate sentences \\nsemantic embedding representations for the creativity responses of Group C (the control group) \\nand Group E (the experimental group), so that we could delved into the semantic content of the \\nanswers. To efficiently reduce dimensions and visualize these complex data sets, we initially \\napplied the PCA algorithm with parameters set to n_components = 30. This step was instrumental \\nin diminishing the data dimensions while preserving essential information. Subsequently, we \\nemployed the UMAP algorithm with parameters including n _components = 2, n_neighbors = 5, \\nmin_dist = 0.001, spread = 1.0, metric= \\'cosine\\', init = \\'spectral\\', random _state = 0, and n_jobs = \\n1, to further decrease dimensions, achieving a more refined two-dimensional representation. The \\nparameter settings for UMAP were specifically chosen to optimize data layout, facilitating clearer \\ndifferentiation between distinct data points. Finally, by normalizing the data within the range of 0 \\nto 1 using MinMaxScaler, we ensured the uniformity and comparability of the data. Through this \\nseries of processing steps, we successfully created semantic embedding density distribution maps \\nfor the creativity responses of Groups C and E, thereby visually depicting the differences in \\ncreativity between the two groups. The covariance matrix for each group was represented by an \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\nellipse, with the ellipse\\'s major and minor axes corresponding to the eigenvalues of the covariance \\nmatrix, and its orientation corresponding to the eigenvectors.  \\nOnce again, the figures demonstrated that the responses generated by the assistance ChatGPT \\n(versus by human-only) generally exerted less standard deviation, eigenvalues, and ellipse area. \\nWhat is more, this tendency was continuing at Day 7 and Day 30.  \\nTable 4a Results of density (Task 1) \\n \\nStandard Deviation \\nSum of Eigenvalues \\nEllipse Area \\n \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nDay1 \\n0.34 \\n0.32 \\n0.12 \\n0.10 \\n0.17 \\n0.15 \\nDay2 \\n0.40 \\n0.33 \\n0.16 \\n0.11 \\n0.24 \\n0.14 \\nDay3 \\n0.34 \\n0.41 \\n0.12 \\n0.17 \\n0.17 \\n0.14 \\nDay4 \\n0.37 \\n0.32 \\n0.14 \\n0.10 \\n0.22 \\n0.16 \\nDay5 \\n0.36 \\n0.33 \\n0.13 \\n0.11 \\n0.19 \\n0.17 \\nDay6 \\n0.37 \\n0.32 \\n0.14 \\n0.10 \\n0.21 \\n0.14 \\nDay7 \\n0.37 \\n0.38 \\n0.14 \\n0.15 \\n0.22 \\n0.22 \\nDay30 \\n0.39 \\n0.32 \\n0.15 \\n0.10 \\n0.23 \\n0.15 \\n \\nTable 4b Results of density (Task 2) \\n \\nStandard Deviation \\nSum of Eigenvalues \\nEllipse Area \\n \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nControl \\nGPT \\nDay1 \\n0.45 \\n0.50 \\n0.21 \\n0.25 \\n0.31 \\n0.15 \\nDay2 \\n0.48 \\n0.49 \\n0.23 \\n0.24 \\n0.22 \\n0.20 \\nDay3 \\n0.46 \\n0.53 \\n0.21 \\n0.28 \\n0.33 \\n0.14 \\nDay4 \\n0.48 \\n0.53 \\n0.23 \\n0.28 \\n0.35 \\n0.15 \\nDay5 \\n0.51 \\n0.54 \\n0.26 \\n0.29 \\n0.29 \\n0.18 \\nDay6 \\n0.47 \\n0.53 \\n0.22 \\n0.28 \\n0.32 \\n0.39 \\nDay7 \\n0.50 \\n0.58 \\n0.25 \\n0.34 \\n0.13 \\n0.12 \\n \\nTaken together, we consistently found that five-days of ChatGPT use led to serious \\nhomogeneity, in which participants generated more creative but less heterogeneous responses. \\nWhat is worse, we found a fraught, continuing effect in knowledge homogeneity in future tasks, in \\nwhich people generated AI-like responses even though they did no use ChatGPT.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n18 \\nFigure4a Task1 (AUT): Comparison of the daily density distribution between the experimental group and the control group \\n \\nNote: ‘A’ presents Task1.

These findings are consistent with \\nother studies in the field. However, our research goes a step further by uncovering that \\nthe group assisted by ChatGPT (the experimental group) generated ideas with \\nsignificantly higher homogeneity than the group working independently (the control \\ngroup). This indicates that the assistance of ChatGPT, due to the uniformity of data \\nsources and tools used, leads to a convergence of ideas at a group level. Consequently, \\nthe use of ChatGPT appears to constrain the diversity of innovation. Even more striking \\nis the long-term impact: 30 days later, upon reassessing both groups with an AUT task \\ncompleted independently, we observed that the experimental group, devoid of \\nChatGPT\\'s assistance, regressed to average creativity levels, aligning with the control \\ngroup. However, the homogeneity of ideas in the experimental group remained higher. \\nThis suggests that the boost in individual creativity afforded by ChatGPT is transient. \\nWhen individuals revert to independent creative activities without ChatGPT, their \\ncreativity capabilities diminish; moreover, from a group perspective, long-term reliance \\non ChatGPT for creative tasks ironically increases homogeneity of thought, \\nsignificantly reducing the diversity of group ideas. This effect remains pronounced even \\nafter one month. \\nFrom a broader societal standpoint, unrestricted use of generative AI tools like \\nChatGPT in scientific research, brainstorming, and innovative activities could lead to \\nunintended and potentially disruptive consequences for the scientific community \\n(Nakadai et al., 2023). This unrestricted application could stifle the diversity of ideas, \\nleading to increasingly similar thoughts among scientists worldwide, and a gradual \\ndiminution of unique innovations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n23 \\n4.1  Implications  \\nFirstly, our study advances the understanding of AI\\'s role in enhancing creativity. \\nThe observed temporary boost in creativity, facilitated by ChatGPT, holds significant \\nimplications for the integration of AI in domains that are heavily reliant on creative \\nprocesses. This insight is crucial for educational psychologists and creative \\nprofessionals, underscoring AI\\'s nuanced role in these fields. While AI tools like \\nChatGPT can significantly aid in immediately resolving creative challenges, their \\nimpact in nurturing long-term creative thinking skills seems limited. This finding \\nprompts a reevaluation in educational and professional settings, where the primary goal \\nis fostering enduring innovative capabilities. A balanced approach is necessary, one tha \\nuses AI tools for immediate creative output while also cultivating and maintaining \\ninherent creative abilities over time. \\nSecondly, our study echoes the challenges posed by ChatGPT to innovation and \\ndiversity in scientific research. The trend toward homogenization of thoughts, \\nevidenced by extensive use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in creative tasks, poses \\nsignificant challenges to the innovation and diversity essential in scientific research. As \\ndemonstrated by our research, the potential for convergence of ideas may stifle \\noriginality and diversity, which are crucial for scientific breakthroughs. This situation \\ncalls for strategic policy-making by research institutions, funding agencies, and \\ndecision-makers (Bockting et al., 2023; Grimes, Von Krogh, Feuerriegel, Rink, & \\nGruber, 2023; Hutson & M, 2023). To ensure diversity in scientific thought and \\ninnovation, a balance between the efficiencies provided by AI and the encouragement \\nof diverse, original scientific inquiry is needed. This might involve policies that \\npromote varied methodologies and perspectives in research projects, even as AI tools \\nbecome increasingly integrated into the scientific process. \\nFinally, the implications of long-term dependency on ChatGPT and the resulting \\nskill degradation warrant attention. The temporary enhancement in creativity by \\nChatGPT, potentially leading to long-term dependency, highlights concerns about \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\npossible skill degradation. This is particularly relevant in educational and professional \\ntraining environments. An over-reliance on AI for creative tasks could lead to a decline \\nin the development and retention of fundamental creative skills. Therefore, a balanced \\napproach is essential when integrating AI into learning and professional domains. The \\nfocus should not be limited to immediate efficiency gains but should also encompass \\nthe development and preservation of critical creative skills, ensuring that AI tools are \\nused as supplements to, rather than replacements for, human creativity. \\nThese implications emphasize the need for a nuanced and balanced approach to \\nintegrating AI into creative and scientific domains. As we harness the benefits of AI, \\nit\\'s critical to remain cognizant of its limitations and potential impacts on creativity, \\ninnovation, skill development, and ethical standards in these fields. This understanding \\nwill guide the responsible and effective use of AI to enhance human potential while \\nsafeguarding the core values and skills that drive innovation and creativity. \\n4.2  Limitations and future directions \\nWhile our experiment offers insightful revelations, it is not without its limitations. \\nTo minimize external interferences, we opted for a laboratory setting and conducted \\ntwo types of creativity tasks to comprehensively assess individual creativity levels. \\nHowever, this approach also meant a lack of field research, particularly for high-\\ncomplexity tasks like developing innovative solutions for corporate products. \\nMoreover, the study\\'s composition, featuring 8 low-complexity AUT tasks and 7 \\nhigh-complexity product solution tasks, resulted in a substantial collection of 3302 \\nideas and 427 solutions. Nevertheless, the participant pool was limited to 61 university \\nstudents, encompassing undergraduates, graduates, and Ph.D. candidates. This raises \\nquestions about the sample\\'s representativeness, a limitation we accepted in exchange \\nfor ensuring participant retention and high-quality engagement over the crucial one-\\nweek period, necessary to foster a dependency on ChatGPT in creative tasks. \\nAdditionally, similar to other researchers, we conducted a follow-up survey, but it \\nwas limited to a single instance, one month after the initial experiment. This approach \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n25 \\nwas designed to capture the essence of \"sustained innovation\" and enhance the external \\nvalidity of our findings. However, we advocate for future research to consider longer \\nfollow-up intervals to more accurately gauge the enduring effects of AI tools like \\nChatGPT on creativity and innovation. \\nDespite these constraints, the core findings of our research offer broad applicability. \\nThe fundamental AUT task proved effective in measuring divergent thinking, with \\nrobust results observed on both the seventh and thirtieth days. This study lays the \\ngroundwork for future exploration into the real-world impacts of ChatGPT in \\nprofessional settings, particularly its potential to narrow the scope of group innovation \\nand induce ideational convergence. There is a pressing need for further research, \\nemploying extended follow-up periods, to unravel the long-term effects of ChatGPT \\ndependency on human creativity. The question of whether such dependency\\'s adverse \\nimpacts exacerbate or diminish over time remains a critical avenue for future inquiry. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\nReference  \\nAcion, L., Rajngewerc, M., Randall, G., & Etcheverry, L. 2023.
